It saved me from a lot of embarrassment in front of my guests. Thank you for your considerate and sensitive attitude towards my problem.

As it was under its warranty, we were given the opportunity to have it repaired for free. The technician did a great job all by himself.

- text: We booked a service call with ARS because the broiler in our electric oven was not working. The technician Eric called an hour before our appointment slot. He offered to come early as his previous call completed earlier than expected. In doing his diagnostics, he confirmed all the electronics were fine. Then he found one loose connection, fixed that, and re-tested everything. We restarted the broiler and it worked. He did a final thorough check to confirm everything was working, which it was. The range needed some height adjustment to fit back into its place safely and to conform to proper installation standards. Eric assisted with that adjustment. He was courteous, friendly, efficient, and took care to protect our appliance and the kitchen counter and floor as he did his work. An excellent service call all around.

We hired a technician through a Google ad. They came in and did NOT resolve our problem. I would argue they made it worse. Fortunately for us, we contacted ARS directly. They came in for a service call. Then they came back on a prompt second visit with the part we needed to fix the washer. Between talking to Catherine from Dispatch and Deron the technician, they fixed our washer. It works better than ever. Thank you so much. What an incredible company. We will be recommending ARS to everyone.

- text: My LG fridge has been beeping like the door is open, but it was not. So no ice or water and the annoying beep every 30 seconds. It started on the holiday Monday. So I called LG warranty on Tuesday. They said someone would come on Friday. They could not tell me the name of the company, though. LG warranty also did not supply the repair company with my cell or proof of age of the fridge. So the ticket was cancelled. Spoke with Gila first thing Friday morning. Dealt with LG service again. Gila made magic happen. She got a technician to come out on a Friday afternoon between other calls to fix my fridge. A mental lifesaver for me, especially having had to listen to the incessant beep every 30 seconds, 24 hours a day. Thank you to the techs. But big thanks to Gila for fitting me in and understanding the necessity. This is the service that AI can never provide; the personal touch makes the difference.

An ARS technician (Daniel) attended. We THOUGHT that it was fixed when Daniel left. However, there was another issue. We called ARS. The dispatcher connected us with Daniel. He had another job after ours but returned well after hours, on the Easter weekend, to ensure that our new fridge was repaired. We are very appreciative of Daniel's dedication and integrity to ensure that we have a working appliance. We would definitely recommend ARS and Daniel for any frustrations involving appliances!

He changed the hinges of the problematic door. Unfortunately, the problem reappeared. ARS sent Rahul again. This time too, he changed the parts. The problem continued. Rahul spoke with the manager. He sent him pictures of the fridge door and explained the problem. Apparently, there was some manufacturing defect. ARS liaised with Samsung. They arranged to replace the fridge since it was well under the warranty period. The problem was not resolvable. My sincere thanks to ARS, particularly to Rahul and his manager, for resolving my problem without much hassle.

In the past, the unit was serviced by Northern Appliances (not at my request). After 5 years of problems and service to this LG fridge, it was all a waste of time and large monies. The issue with the fridge could have been resolved a couple of years ago. But Northern staff obviously had a different agenda. I will request ARS in the future. But hope this is the last time an appliance in my home will have to be serviced!

- text: What great customer service! We had an issue with ice forming in our Samsung fridge since the water was not draining out as it should. We reached out to Samsung Canada to resolve the issue. Samsung Canada referred us to ARS. We are so glad they did. They promptly scheduled an appointment. Andre, the technician, did a great job. He arrived on time. He finished the work promptly. He also shared some tips to keep the fridge working efficiently. The issue was resolved. The fridge is working properly. We're very happy and thankful for the great service.

- text: The ARS technician Qaiser was friendly and very knowledgeable. He came to assess my washing machine. He asked a lot of questions to help him understand the issue. He stayed for a full spin cycle to make sure I knew what the problem was. This left me feeling very confident that it was fixed. He shared good advice too. I will call ARS again and ask for Qaiser in the future. I have already recommended him to family.

- text: Thank you for great service. The issue was with the Samsung ice maker. Then more issues were added. Everything was broken. Basically, the fridge and freezer warmed up. So after a few times fixing and figuring out what's wrong with it, everything works perfectly now. Thanks to the knowledgeable technician.

- text: Amazing service. This Samsung fridge has had an issue with the ice maker since I bought it. After multiple complaints to Samsung and multiple companies coming to my house wasting my time. They just thawed it out and said it's a design flaw. I almost gave up. Then I gave it one more chance. ARS was the company that came and finally solved my problem. The technician was super nice. You could tell he knew what he was doing. The ice maker has never worked better, no more freezing!!!!!! Thanks, ARS; you did an awesome job.
