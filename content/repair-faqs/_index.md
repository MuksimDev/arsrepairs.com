## Warranty & Repairs

### What warranty do you offer on appliance repairs?

We provide a 90-day Limited Warranty on all appliance repair labour and a 30-day warranty on replacement parts. This coverage applies only to the same issue initially repaired. It does not cover unrelated problems, third-party damage, or misuse.

### What if the part fails again under warranty?

If a part we installed fails during the 30-day parts warranty period, we will replace it at no cost for the part itself. However, shipping and handling costs are the responsibility of the customer.

### Is the warranty transferable if I sell the appliance?

No. The warranty is non-transferable and applies only to the original customer who received the service.

## Service Fees & Pricing

### How much is the service call fee?

The service call (diagnosis) fee is $120 + tax. This includes travel, technician time, and assessment. It is credited toward your repair cost if you proceed with the repair.

### Is the service call fee refundable?

No. The service call fee is non-refundable. However, it acts as a deposit toward your final repair cost if the work is completed.

### How are repair costs determined?

Repair costs are based on the type of repair and required parts, not how long it takes. A full estimate is provided before work begins.

## Appointments & Cancellations

### How are appointments scheduled?

Appointments are scheduled in 3-hour windows between 9 AM and 5 PM. The system assigns time slots based on technician availability and proximity.

### What if I need to cancel my appointment?

Please cancel at least 12 hours in advance. A $60 fee applies to last-minute cancellations, missed appointments, or unreachable customers at the scheduled time.

## Payments & Terms

### When is payment due?

Payment is due upon completion of the repair. Late payments may incur a 1.5% monthly fee. Collection costs are the customer's responsibility.

### Do you offer repair estimates?

Yes. All estimates are valid for 7 days. Any payment confirms acceptance of the terms and estimate.

## Parts & Installation

### What kind of parts do you use?

We use original or equivalent-quality replacement parts. All installed parts are covered under our 30-day parts warranty unless excluded (e.g., special-order or electrical parts).

### What if a part takes time to arrive?

Parts are sourced from third-party suppliers and delivery timelines depend on the manufacturer. Once parts arrive, we schedule installation promptly.

### What's included in your installation charge?

Standard installation includes appliance removal and setup, but does not include gas, plumbing, or electrical modifications. Materials and extra labour (e.g., stacked units) may be billed separately.

## Customer Responsibilities

### What should I do before the technician arrives?

Ensure someone 18+ is home, the appliance is accessible, and units are unstacked. Have payment ready. We do not accept checks or e-transfers.

### Will the technician move my appliance?

Only if necessary and at your request. We are not responsible for any resulting damage. A waiver may be required.

## Additional Policies

### What happens if damage occurs during service?

We are not liable for water leaks, movement damage, defective cooling, or breakage while accessing components. See our full damage waiver for details.

### Do you replace appliances?

No. We only repair appliances. If your unit cannot be fixed, our technician will advise you accordingly.

### Can ARS refuse service?

Yes. We reserve the right to refuse service in cases of unsafe or disrespectful behavior. A service call fee may still apply.

## Additional FAQs

### Can I book without a credit card?

No. A valid credit card is required at the time of booking to confirm your appointment.

### What appliance brands do you service?

We repair most major home appliance brands including Whirlpool, LG, Samsung, GE, Frigidaire, Bosch, Maytag, KitchenAid, and more.

### Do you perform repairs under manufacturer or extended warranties?

Yes. We often work as third-party technicians. If your provider denies payment, you are responsible for the repair cost.
