  title: Frequently Asked Questions About ASKO Repair
  items:
  - question: Do you use genuine ASKO parts?
    answer: Yes. When OEM components are required, we install genuine ASKO parts sourced
      from authorized suppliers to maintain performance, fit, and appliance longevity.
  - question: Which ASKO appliances can you repair?
    answer: We repair ASKO dishwashers, front-load washers, heat pump dryers, and
      matching laundry systems. These premium Scandinavian appliances require brand-specific
      diagnostic knowledge, which our technicians are trained for.
  - question: Are you factory-trained for ASKO?
    answer: Several of our technicians have brand-specific training for ASKO products,
      including stainless-steel tub dishwashers, Quattro suspension laundry systems,
      and heat-pump drying platforms.
  - question: Is ASKO repair expensive?
    answer: ASKO appliances are premium units, and some parts may be higher in cost.
      We provide a flat diagnostic fee and an upfront repair quote before any work
      begins.
  - question: Do you honor ASKO warranties?
    answer: If your ASKO appliance is under warranty, we can help direct you through
      the correct warranty path. For out-of-warranty repairs, ARS provides full service
      with parts and labour coverage.
  - question: Are ASKO appliances repairable?
    answer: Yes. ASKO dishwashers and laundry products are built for longevity. With
      proper diagnostics, most issues can be repaired at a fraction of the cost of
      replacement.

## Why Professional ASKO Repair Matters

ASKO appliances use advanced components such as stainless-steel wash systems, high-efficiency pumps, specialized suspension, and sensor-driven heating. Without proper diagnosis, repairs can lead to repeat failures or long-term strain on motors and electronics.

Expert repair helps:

{{< list >}}
Restore ASKO dishwasher cleaning power and water pressure
Prevent washer vibration, leaks, and repeated drain pump issues
Resolve heat-pump dryer temperature imbalance and airflow restrictions
Protect premium internal components from premature wear
Ensure quiet, efficient operation designed by ASKO's engineering standards
{{< /list >}}

We test performance under working conditions before completing any repair.
