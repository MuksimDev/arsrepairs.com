  title: Frequently Asked Questions About Bertazzoni Repair
  items:
  - question: Do you use genuine Bertazzoni parts?
    answer: Yes. When OEM components are required, we install genuine Bertazzoni parts
      or equivalent-grade replacements sourced from authorized suppliers to ensure
      correct fit and long-term performance.
  - question: Which Bertazzoni appliances do you repair?
    answer: We repair Bertazzoni ovens, ranges, cooktops, built-in fridges / fridge-freezers,
      dishwashers (when available), and ventilation hoods, the full premium kitchen
      appliance lineup sold in Canada.
  - question: Are you trained for European-spec installations?
    answer: Yes. Our technicians have experience with Bertazzoni's Italian-made systems,
      including gas and induction cooktops, convection ovens, built-in refrigeration,
      and ventilation requirements.
  - question: How much does Bertazzoni repair cost?
    answer: Repair costs vary depending on the complexity and availability of parts.
      We always provide a flat-rate diagnostic fee and a full repair estimate before
      beginning any work.
  - question: Do you support older or imported Bertazzoni units?
    answer: Yes. We regularly service both current Canadian-market Bertazzoni appliances
      and older or privately imported European-spec units, depending on parts availability.
  - question: Is it worth repairing premium Bertazzoni appliances instead of replacing?
    answer: Often yes, Bertazzoni appliances are high-end and built for longevity.
      Proper repair usually restores full functionality at a fraction of replacement
      cost.
