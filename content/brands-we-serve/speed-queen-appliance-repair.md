  title: Frequently Asked Questions About Speed Queen Repair
  items:
  - question: Do you use genuine Speed Queen parts?
    answer: Yes. When OEM parts are required, we install genuine Speed Queen components
      sourced through authorized channels to ensure long-term durability and proper
      mechanical operation.
  - question: Which Speed Queen appliances do you repair?
    answer: We repair residential and commercial Speed Queen washers, dryers, and
      stacked laundry centres. These are the full lineup available in Canada.
  - question: Are you factory-trained for Speed Queen?
    answer: Many of our technicians are experienced with Speed Queen's commercial-grade
      build, including transmission systems, heavy-duty motors, and electronic or
      mechanical controls.
  - question: Do you repair Speed Queen commercial laundry equipment?
    answer: Yes. We service Speed Queen commercial washers and dryers used in multi-housing
      buildings, laundromats, gyms, and small business facilities.
  - question: How much does Speed Queen repair cost?
    answer: Costs depend on the appliance, model, and issue. We provide a flat-rate
      diagnosis and an upfront repair quote before any work begins.
  - question: Are Speed Queen machines worth repairing?
    answer: In most cases, yes. Speed Queen appliances are built for longevity, and
      repairing a failed component is often far more cost-effective than replacing
      the unit.
