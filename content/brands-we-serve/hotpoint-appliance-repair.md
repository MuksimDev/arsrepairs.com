  title: Frequently Asked Questions About Hotpoint Repair
  items:
  - question: Do you use genuine Hotpoint parts?
    answer: Yes. When OEM parts are required, we install genuine Hotpoint components
      to ensure proper fit, long-term reliability, and manufacturer-approved performance.
  - question: Which Hotpoint appliances do you repair?

    answer: Several of our technicians are trained on Hotpoint systems, including
      Whirlpool-family and GE-influenced designs depending on model generation.
  - question: How much does Hotpoint repair cost?
    answer: Pricing varies by appliance and issue. We provide flat-rate diagnostics
