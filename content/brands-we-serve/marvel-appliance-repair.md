  title: Frequently Asked Questions About Marvel Repair
  items:
  - question: Do you use genuine Marvel parts?
    answer: Yes. When OEM parts are required, we install genuine Marvel components
      sourced through authorized suppliers for proper fit, performance, and long-term
      reliability.
  - question: Which Marvel appliances do you repair?
    answer: We repair Marvel wine coolers, beverage centers, under-counter fridges,
      freezer drawers, ice makers, and outdoor refrigeration units.
  - question: Are you factory-trained for Marvel?
    answer: Several of our technicians have training on Marvel's premium cooling systems,
      including dual-zone wine coolers, forced-air refrigeration, and specialty ice
      production models.
  - question: How much does Marvel repair cost?
    answer: Repair costs vary by model and issue. Premium Marvel units may use specialty
      cooling components, but we always provide a clear, flat-rate estimate before
      any work begins.
  - question: Do you honor Marvel warranties?
    answer: If your Marvel appliance is under manufacturer warranty, we help direct
      you to the correct warranty process. For out-of-warranty units, ARS provides
