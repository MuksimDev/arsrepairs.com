  title: Frequently Asked Questions About Hisense Repair
  items:
  - question: Do you use genuine Hisense parts?
    answer: Yes. When OEM components are required, we install genuine Hisense parts
      sourced from authorized suppliers to ensure proper fit, durability, and long-term
      performance.
  - question: Can you repair all Hisense appliances?
    answer: We repair Hisense fridges, freezers, dishwashers, washing machines, dryers,
      freestanding ranges, and cooktops. Our technicians understand Hisense compressor
      systems, digital controls, and high-efficiency laundry platforms.
  - question: Are you factory-trained for Hisense?
    answer: Many of our technicians receive brand-specific training for Hisense and
      similar global appliance systems, including inverter compressors and electronic
      stability controls.
  - question: How much does Hisense repair cost?
    answer: Costs depend on the appliance and the issue. We provide a flat diagnostic
      fee followed by a clear, written estimate before any work begins.
  - question: Do you honor Hisense warranties?
    answer: If your Hisense appliance is under manufacturer warranty, we can guide
      you through the proper warranty process. For out-of-warranty repairs, ARS provides
      full service with parts and labour coverage.
  - question: Are Hisense appliances repairable?
    answer: Yes. Hisense appliances use mainstream components, which makes most cooling,
      washing, and heating repairs practical and cost-effective compared to replacement.
