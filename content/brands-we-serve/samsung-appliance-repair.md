  title: Frequently Asked Questions About Samsung Repair
  items:
  - question: Do you use genuine Samsung parts?
    answer: Yes. We install genuine Samsung components sourced through authorized
      suppliers. This maintains proper fit, long-term reliability, and manufacturer-level
      performance.
  - question: Can you repair Samsung smart appliances?
    answer: Absolutely. We repair Samsung smart fridges, washers, dryers, ranges,
      and dishwashers equipped with Wi-Fi, digital sensors, touchscreen controls,
      and SmartThings features.
  - question: Are you factory-authorized for Samsung?
    answer: Our technicians are factory-authorized for Samsung, giving them access
      to OEM parts, brand-specific tools, technical bulletins, and Samsung-approved
      service procedures.
  - question: How much does Samsung repair cost?
    answer: Pricing depends on the model and the issue. We provide a flat-rate diagnostic
      fee followed by a clear, upfront repair estimate. Smart appliances or sealed-system
      issues may cost more due to complexity.
  - question: Do you honor Samsung warranties?
    answer: If your Samsung appliance is under warranty, we guide you through Samsung's
      official warranty process. For out-of-warranty units, ARS provides full parts-and-labour
      repair coverage.
  - question: Can you repair Samsung ice maker issues?
    answer: Yes. We frequently repair Samsung ice makers affected by frozen fill tubes,
      faulty valves, defective auger motors, or ice maker assembly failure. These
      are common issues our technicians handle daily.

Professional Samsung repair helps:

{{< list >}}
Protect compressors, motors, and electronic boards
Prevent internal ice buildup or cooling loss in smart fridges
Ensure washers and dryers run safe, balanced cycles
Avoid electrical faults, overheating, or shutdowns
Restore correct temperature and airflow management

Our technicians test Samsung appliances under load, run diagnostic cycles, and verify performance against manufacturer specifications.
