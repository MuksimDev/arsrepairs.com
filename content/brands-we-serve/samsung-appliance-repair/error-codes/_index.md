## Samsung Washer & Dryer Error Codes

If your Samsung washer is flashing a strange error code, you're not alone, and you're not stuck. Whether it's a front loader, top loader, FlexWash, or one of the older WA or WF models, these machines are built to alert you when something's off. But those cryptic combinations of letters and numbers can be confusing. That's why we've broken down the most common Samsung washer error codes by model, so you know exactly what each one means and what might be causing the issue. Whether it's a drain problem, water fill issue, or something with the door lock or motor, this guide will help you make sense of it quickly.

### Standard Samsung Washer (Front / Top Load)
