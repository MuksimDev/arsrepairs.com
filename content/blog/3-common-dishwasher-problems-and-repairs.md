Let's face it your household depends on your dishwasher to clean all of your dirty dishes, kitchen utensils, and not to mention all of your pots and pans. So it's important that you have a reliable dishwasher or nothing stinks then having no clean dishes lying around. Because your dishwasher is one of the most-used appliances in your household, you might encounter a few problems if you aren't maintaining it from time to time. So here are three common dishwasher problems that have quick solutions.

Caution: Remember to always unplug your dishwasher before making any repairs.

## 1\. Dishwasher Doesn't Run

If you turn on the dishwasher and it doesn't run, most likely, there's a problem with the power. Check to see that the door is securely latched and the control is engaged. Or unplug it and press the reset button if the dishwasher's cord is plugged into a GFCI receptacle.

Check the electrical panel on the dishwasher for a tripped circuit or a blown fuse. If this is the case, switch the breaker to off and then back on. If this doesn't work, replace the fuse.

## 2\. Dishwasher Runs, But Doesn't Fill Up With Water

Check to see that the water is turned on. Check the hot water supply stop valve, located under the sink. Turn it counter clockwise all the way to open up the valve.

Another solution is to after when the dishwasher is cool (don't do this right after a wash cycle), look for the float inside the dishwasher, this looks like a small plastic dome or cylinder mounted inside at the tub's base, near the front. Lift out the float mechanism and clean with a damp rag around the float tube. Or you can disconnect the float from below, but you have to remove the lower access panel. Once the float is removed, rinse it off with water and then put it back in the tube. Make sure the float moves up and down properly when you put it back.

### 3\. Dishwasher Overfills

If the dishwasher water flow doesn't automatically shut off, then there could be a problem with the float, the timer might be stuck on Fill, or the water inlet valve is stuck open. Once the dishwasher overfills, immediately unplug the dishwasher. Reach into the cabinet and lift up the dome-shaped plastic float switch. Doesn't lift up? Then remove the plastic top from the stem, clean the stem, and then replace the dome.
