**Effective Date:** January 2025

Before our technician begins any work, it is essential that you thoroughly acquaint yourself with this Agreement. Allowing our technician to initiate service implies your complete acceptance of the terms outlined in this Agreement. We appreciate your attention to these terms, which govern our appliance repair services.

1. **APPOINTMENTS:**

Our appointment scheduling is designed to provide you with the earliest available service window between 9 am and 5 pm. To ensure a smooth and convenient experience, we will assign a 3-hour appointment window one day before the scheduled service. To confirm your appointment, we kindly request that you respond either via email or by phone, but there's no need to confirm through both channels. Your response through either method will be greatly appreciated. We will agree on a timeline that is heavily influenced by the closest technician to maximize efficiency. We do not choose the time ourselves, it is designated by the system.

Please be aware that failing to confirm your appointment may result in us being unable to guarantee the service at the scheduled time. Additionally, for part installation appointments, we will schedule them once the necessary part(s) have arrived. We appreciate your cooperation in adhering to these appointment guidelines, which help us serve you more efficiently.

2. **SERVICE CALL FEE:**

When you request a service call with one of our qualified technicians, a service call fee of 120 + tax will be applied. This fee covers two main components:

* **Travel and Assessment Time:** The service call fee includes the time it takes for our technician to leave our office, travel to your location, and perform an initial analysis of the problem with your appliance. This initial assessment helps us understand the issue and what may be needed to fix it. Please note that this fee is not for the actual repair work but for this essential evaluation step.
* **Non-Refundable Fee:** The service call fee is non-refundable, meaning that once it's charged, it will not be returned or refunded, regardless of the outcome of the service call.

**Service Call Fee: Credit Towards Repair**

Here's where it gets important:

**Credit for Repairs:** While the service call fee is initially charged, it is not an extra cost. Instead, it's a credit that gets applied towards the final cost of your appliance repair. In other words, you're making an initial payment for the service call, but this payment is later transformed into a credit that reduces the overall amount you'll pay for the complete appliance repair. This way, you're not paying an additional $120 for the service call; you're investing it towards resolving the issue with your appliance as well.

It's worth noting that in cases where the problem is determined to be caused by factors unrelated to the appliance itself, such as installation issues, plumbing problems, electrical issues, venting duct blockages, or any other issue not directly related to the appliance, the service call fee will still apply. Additionally, please ensure suitable parking is available, as our technicians may need to cancel the service if parking is restricted or unavailable in certain areas.

We hope this explanation clarifies our service call fee process and how it ultimately benefits you by offsetting the cost of your appliance repair.

**Service Call Fee: Like a Down Payment**

Think of the $120 service call fee as a down payment for our first visit. You pay this amount upfront when our technician comes to assess your appliance. However, here's the important part: that same $120 is not an extra charge. It's actually like money in the bank for your appliance repair. It gets deducted from the final bill, reducing the total amount you will owe.

So, you're investing $120 in the initial service call, but getting a $120 discount on the repair work that needs to be done. It's a way to make sure you're not paying more than you need to for the entire repair process.

3. **ESTIMATES:**

Our estimates are valid for a period of 7 days from the date of issuance. It's important to note that any payment made by the customer, whether it's a deposit, payment for parts, labor, or any other related fees, signifies the customer's explicit acceptance of the provided estimate. This payment also serves as a clear agreement to adhere to all the terms and conditions detailed herein. We appreciate your understanding of this crucial aspect of our service.

4. **PAYMENT:**

All payment for services rendered is due upon the completion of the job.

In cases where payments are overdue, a late fee will be applied at a rate of 1.5% per month or the highest rate permitted by law, whichever is smaller. This policy is in place to ensure prompt and fair payment for our services.

It is important to note that the customer agrees to be responsible for covering all collection expenses, including but not limited to attorneys' fees, in the event that collection efforts become necessary.

We appreciate your understanding of these payment terms, which help us maintain efficient and transparent financial transactions.

5. **WARRANTY:**

Our commitment to your satisfaction includes a **90-day warranty on labor** and a **30-day warranty on replacement parts**. This coverage applies to the same problem that we initially repaired. However, it's important to note that this warranty is specific to the issue we addressed during our service call and does not extend to cover any other problems or repairs performed by third parties.

This warranty also does not apply if the appliance malfunctions due to factors beyond our control, such as weather damage or pests.

Please be aware that this warranty is exclusive to the customer and is non-transferable to others. Additionally, it is void in cases of improper appliance usage, inadequate maintenance, or when the appliance has been relocated.

In cases where our service technician makes multiple visits to address the same warranty issue, but no defect is identified or it is determined to fall outside the scope of the warranty, a service call fee will be applicable for the additional service.

We reserve the right to assess whether offering a warranty is in the best interest of both parties. If our technician discovers secondary issues unrelated to the workmanship performed by our team, we will provide you with a quote for the associated repair costs.

Please note that no refunds will be issued for labor or parts already provided, but we may consider partial refunds at our discretion.

It's important to emphasize that this warranty does not cover damage caused by external problems or interference by anyone other than our technicians, who have undergone extensive training to ensure the quality of our repairs. Your understanding of these warranty terms is greatly appreciated as we aim to maintain transparency and fairness in our service offerings.

6. **CANCELLATIONS:**

In the event you need to cancel a scheduled appointment, we kindly request that you do so no later than 12 hours prior to the scheduled service time. This advance notice allows us to adjust our schedule and accommodate other customers effectively.

Please be aware that a cancellation fee of $60 will be billed to customers who cancel late, cannot be reached, or are not present at home at the scheduled service time. We understand that unforeseen circumstances may arise, so if you find yourself unable to keep an appointment, we urge you to notify us as soon as possible.

In situations where we are unable to answer your call immediately, please feel free to leave a message or send an email. Your cooperation in adhering to these cancellation guidelines helps us maintain efficient service and serve all our customers effectively.

7. **REPAIR COST:**

Our pricing for repair services is determined by the nature of the job and the specific requirements of your appliance. It is important to note that our charges are based on the complexity and extent of the repair needed, not on the time it takes to perform the repair. This approach ensures fairness and transparency in our pricing, as it accurately reflects the resources, materials, and expertise required to address your appliance issues. We appreciate your understanding of our commitment to providing cost-effective and value-driven repair services.

8. **LIABILITY RELEASE:**

By engaging our services, the customer agrees to release ARS Repair and Installation Services Inc., its owners, employees, and technicians from any and all liability, both express and implied, arising from damages and expenses of any nature that may result from the repair of the customer's appliance(s). This release is in place to protect both parties and maintain a clear understanding of the responsibilities and limitations associated with our repair services. We value your trust and cooperation in this matter.

9. **SERVICE SPECIALIZATION:**

At ARS, we specialize in appliance repair. We want to make it perfectly clear what you can expect when you choose us:

* **Repair, Not Replacement:** Our primary focus is on repairing appliances, not replacing them. Our skilled technicians are experts in diagnosing and fixing issues with a wide range of appliances.
* **Parts Replacement:** If the necessary parts are accessible and available, we have the capability to replace them as part of our repair process. This means that we can often restore your appliance to proper working condition by replacing faulty components when we come back a second time to complete services. We do not manufacture parts, so we aren't responsible for the timeliness of the manufacturer or supplier.
* **Third-Party Technicians:** If you have a warranty for your appliance, it's important to understand that we typically act as third-party technicians enlisted to assist you in repairing your appliance. We work in cooperation with your warranty provider to ensure that your appliance is repaired correctly. We are not your warranty provider or manufacturer.
* **Direct Service Calls:** If you're contacting us directly to address an appliance issue on your own accord, we can come to your location, perform a service call, assess the problem, order any necessary parts, and proceed with repairing your appliance.
* **Limitations:** However, it's crucial to note that while we excel at appliance repair, we do not have the capacity to replace your appliance with a new one. Our expertise lies in diagnosing, repairing, and restoring your appliance's functionality.

By choosing ARS, you're selecting a team of skilled professionals dedicated to keeping your appliances in top working order. We're here to provide expert repair services and help you make the most of your appliances' lifespan.

10. **CUSTOMER RESPONSIBILITIES:**

For the technician to provide service, it is required that someone 18 years of age or older be present at the time of service.

Customers are kindly requested to have a valid form of payment readily available at all times during the technician's scheduled visit. Please note that we do not accept checks as a form of payment or e-transfers.

To ensure a smooth service experience, our technician must have unrestricted, easy access to the appliance without interference from children, pets, or other distractions. In cases where the washer and dryer are stacked, please dismount them and ensure that the appliances are emptied prior to the technician's arrival.

We are also not liable for moving the appliance. If the customer requests or requires us to do so, please be aware that we are not responsible for any potential issues that may arise. It is essential to understand that there is a liability waiver in place, and ensuring the unit's accessibility remains the customer's responsibility.

As a courtesy to our technicians and the safety of all parties involved, we kindly request that customers refrain from smoking cigarettes in the proximity of the technician.

Additionally, it's essential to highlight that if the unit being serviced is not installed to the manufacturer's standards, we are unable to proceed with the service. In such cases, we will not be responsible for any return of payments for the service call. We appreciate your cooperation in adhering to these customer responsibilities, as they help us provide efficient and effective service.

11. **INSTALLATION CHARGE:**

Our standard installation charge encompasses the removal and/or installation of an appliance, without necessitating the disturbance or removal of any other fixtures. Please be aware that the repair or modification of gas, water, ventilation, or electrical systems is not included in this charge.

We do not undertake the verification of regulatory compliance for these systems; it is solely the customer's responsibility to ensure compliance. Additionally, it's important to note that the installation charge quoted does not cover the cost of materials such as vent hoses, water lines, gas lines, hoses, fittings, and similar items.

In cases where the installation of an appliance requires the assistance of a second person (e.g., for stacked washer and dryer units), an additional person will be billed separately.

Furthermore, please be advised that a service call fee will be applied if the installation cannot proceed as scheduled. We appreciate your cooperation in understanding these installation charge details, which allow us to provide efficient and transparent service.

12. **PARTS:**

At ARS, we are dedicated to using only original parts or equivalent quality parts to ensure the optimal performance and longevity of your appliance.

In the event that the parts we install fail during the warranty period, we are committed to covering the cost of replacement parts. However, please note that shipping and handling fees for these replacement parts will be the responsibility of the customer.

For parts that fail due to normal wear and tear outside of the warranty period, we will apply our regular rates for replacement parts and labor.

Furthermore, we offer a 15-day money-back guarantee on parts bought separately or over the counter. Beyond this initial 15-day period, a restocking fee of 25% will be applied. It's important to mention that shipping and handling charges are non-refundable, and electrical or special-order parts cannot be returned.

Regarding the time required to procure parts, please be aware that it is not within our direct control, as we act as a third party in this process. We strive to act promptly upon receiving the necessary parts, but the timeline for obtaining parts ultimately depends on the manufacturer. Rest assured, once we have the required parts, we will execute the repair without delay to minimize any inconvenience to you.

**Important Note:** If a customer decides to proceed with the service after the initial service call, pays the deposit, and we order the necessary parts, any subsequent cancellation will still incur the 25% restocking fee. We appreciate your understanding of these terms, which help us provide efficient and transparent service.

13. **RECOMMENDATIONS:**

While we are committed to providing expert advice and recommendations to our customers, it's important to clarify that we are not responsible for any work that is not directly performed by our team, even if a customer chooses to follow our recommendations.

Our recommendations are offered as a service to assist you in making informed decisions regarding your appliance. However, any work or actions taken based on our recommendations are the sole responsibility of the customer or the third party chosen to perform the work.

We appreciate your understanding of this distinction, which allows us to provide valuable guidance while ensuring clarity in our responsibilities and limitations.

14. **COMPLETED REPAIR:**

A repair is considered complete when the technician has determined that the unit is now working, and they mark the job as "repair completed." This signifies the customer's acknowledgment that the appliance has been repaired and serviced to their satisfaction.

Payment in full also serves as confirmation that the customer has thoroughly reviewed and tested the appliance post-repair. It is important to note that once a repair is marked as completed, we do not offer refunds for either completed or ongoing repair work. This policy ensures that we maintain transparency and consistency in our service offerings. We appreciate your understanding of this aspect of our service.

15. **LIMITATION OF LIABILITY:**

We want to make it abundantly clear that our liability is limited to the service fees collected from the customer. In no event shall either party to these terms be held liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages arising from a breach of warranty, breach of contract, negligence, or any other legal theory in connection with these Terms and Conditions.

Additionally, please be aware that our primary focus is on repairing appliances, and we do not offer replacement services. Our expertise lies in diagnosing and fixing issues with a wide range of appliances, ensuring their continued functionality. Your understanding of these limitations and terms is greatly appreciated as we strive to provide transparent and efficient service.

16. **WARRANTY / EXTENDED WARRANTY / SERVICE CONTRACT:**

We want to clarify the payment process for repairs conducted under manufacturer warranties, extended warranties, or service agreements:

Upon requesting a repair under these agreements, we confirm that the repair will be paid for by the respective manufacturer warranty, extended warranty, or service agreement provider.

However, it is important to understand that your liability for the cost of this repair is not waived. You agree to be personally responsible for the cost of this repair in the event that the manufacturer, service contract company, or extended warranty provider fails to cover any portion of the full amount due to warranty limitations. We kindly remind you that it is your responsibility to be aware of and comply with the manufacturer's or extended warranty's terms and limitations.

In situations where the warranty provider does not make payment, you agree to remit the charges within 10 days of the billing date. Additionally, you are responsible for covering the reasonable cost of collection, including any associated attorney fees.

We appreciate your understanding of these payment terms, which help us maintain clarity and efficiency in handling repairs conducted under warranty or service agreements.

17. **DAMAGE WAIVERS:**

We want to clarify our position regarding liability in cases where damage may occur:

* **Moving the Appliance:** Please note that our technicians are not required to move the appliance during service. However, if a technician agrees to do so at your request, we cannot be held responsible for any resulting damages.
* **Water Leaks:** We understand that working on appliances connected to a building's plumbing system carries inherent risks. Therefore, we shall not be liable for any unintended leakage or flooding that may occur during the course of our work.
* **Defective Cooling:** In cases where an appliance exhibits defective cooling, we want to emphasize that we cannot be held liable for the malfunction itself.
* **Lifting Glass Cooktops:** When it becomes necessary to lift a glass cooktop to access parts beneath it, there is a risk of breakage. In such instances, we want to clarify that we cannot be held liable for any breakage that may occur.

Your understanding of these damage waivers is greatly appreciated, as they help us maintain transparency and ensure that you are aware of the associated risks and limitations when seeking our appliance repair services.

18. **REFUSAL OF SERVICE:**

We want to assure our valued customers that we are committed to providing the highest level of service. However, we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone at our discretion. This measure is typically taken in cases of disrespectful or disruptive behavior that may compromise the safety and efficiency of our technicians or any team member.

Please be aware that in situations where service is refused due to customer actions or behavior, a service call fee may be charged. Our goal is to maintain a respectful and safe working environment for our technicians while delivering top-notch service.

19. **ADDITIONAL NOTES:**

* **Call Time:** We understand that service timeframes can vary, and we do our best to provide timely service. However, please keep in mind that exact service times can be subject to factors beyond our control, such as location and technician availability.
* **Credit Card Hold:** For your convenience, we will place a one-dollar hold on your credit card to authorize future charges if necessary. Rest assured, this hold will be automatically released after three days.
* **Credit Card Booking:** Please be aware that we require a credit card at the time of booking. Without a credit card, we are unable to schedule an appointment.
* **Two Technicians:** In cases where two technicians are dispatched and they provide the same diagnosis or findings, please note (NFF) will be charged for the redundancy.
* **Same Day Service:** Same Day Service can be offered based on our availability.
* **Difficult Parking Fee:** In urban areas with similar challenges, such as downtown Toronto, where parking is limited and accessibility is difficult, a $24 surcharge is applicable.

We greatly appreciate your feedback and your choice to entrust us with your appliance repair needs. Our dedicated ARS Team is here to ensure that your appliances are back in optimal working condition.
