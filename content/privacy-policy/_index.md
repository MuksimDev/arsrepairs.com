**Last updated:** October 20, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how **ARS Repair and Installation Services Inc.** ("ARS," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, discloses, and protects personal information obtained through the appliancesrepairservice.ca website (the "Site") and our related services. By using our Site, submitting a form, or engaging our services, you agree to the practices described below, in compliance with applicable Canadian privacy laws.

## 1. Applicable Laws

ARS operates in Ontario, Canada. Our handling of personal information is governed by the **Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)** and related federal regulations. Ontario currently does not have its own private-sector privacy law, but we follow the principles and guidance of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario. We will update this Policy if new provincial privacy legislation takes effect.

## 4. SMS/Text Message Updates and Marketing

ARS may send SMS/text messages for service reminders, scheduling updates, and promotional offers. Participation is optional and requires your express consent under **Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL)**.

### 4.1 Consent

By opting in via our online form, checkbox, or by texting a designated keyword, you agree to receive text messages from ARS related to your service or promotions. Consent is not a condition of purchase or service.

## 7. Cross-Border Data Transfers and U.S. Hosting

Our website and some related systems are hosted on servers located in the **United States**. This means that personal information may be transferred and stored outside of Canada. While in the U.S., your information may be subject to access by U.S. law enforcement under applicable laws. We take reasonable steps to ensure that any service providers handling your data maintain safeguards that offer a comparable level of protection to Canadian standards under PIPEDA, including contractual commitments and security controls.

## 8. Sharing Personal Information

* **Service Providers:** We share limited personal information with vendors and contractors who perform services such as hosting, appointment management, customer communication, and analytics. They are bound by confidentiality and data-protection obligations.
* **Legal Obligations:** We may disclose information when required by law or to protect our rights, property, or safety.
* **Business Transactions:** In the event of a merger, acquisition, or asset transfer, customer information may be included under equivalent safeguards.

We do not sell or rent personal information to any third party.

## 9. Data Retention and Security

We retain personal information only as long as necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy or as required by law. We use physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to protect data from loss, theft, unauthorized access, disclosure, or alteration.

* **Access and Correction:** You may request access to or correction of your personal information.
