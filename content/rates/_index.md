  title: Frequently Asked Questions About Our Rates
  items:
  - question: How do you determine repair pricing?
    answer: We use flat-rate pricing based on the specific repair needed. After diagnosing
      the issue, we provide a clear, written estimate that includes all parts and
      labour. The price is fixed, no hourly surprises or hidden fees.
  - question: Do you charge for diagnostic visits?
    answer: Yes, we charge a diagnostic fee that covers the technician's time to identify
      the problem. This fee is typically applied toward the repair cost if you choose
      to proceed with the work. We'll explain the diagnostic fee when you schedule
      your appointment.
  - question: Are there any hidden fees or surprise charges?
    answer: No. We provide a complete, written estimate before any work begins. The
      price you're quoted is the price you'll pay, unless you request additional work
      or we discover something unexpected that requires your approval.
  - question: What if the repair costs more than the appliance is worth?
    answer: We'll be honest with you. If an older appliance would cost more to repair
      than it's worth, or if replacement makes more sense, we'll tell you directly.
      We'll help you weigh your options so you can make an informed decision.
  - question: Do you offer payment plans or financing?
    answer: Payment is typically due upon completion of service. We accept cash, credit
      cards, and debit. For larger repairs or installations, please contact us to
      discuss payment options.
  - question: Is there a difference in pricing for emergency or after-hours service?
    answer: Emergency and after-hours service may include additional fees. We'll always
      disclose these fees upfront when you schedule your appointment so there are
      no surprises.

At {{< company-name >}}, we believe in complete transparency when it comes to pricing. Before any repair work begins, our technicians provide a detailed explanation of what's wrong with your appliance and a clear, written estimate for the recommended repair. You'll know exactly what you're paying for and why, with no hidden fees or surprise charges.

We use flat-rate pricing, which means the price you're quoted is the price you'll pay, no hourly rate surprises or unexpected costs. If we discover something unexpected during the repair that requires additional work, we'll stop and get your approval before proceeding.

## Our Pricing Philosophy

We understand that appliance repairs can be stressful, especially when you're dealing with a broken refrigerator, washer, or oven. That's why we've built our pricing model around transparency and honesty:

- **Upfront Estimates**: Every repair starts with a clear, written estimate
- **Flat-Rate Pricing**: Fixed prices based on the specific repair, not hourly rates
- **No Surprises**: The price you're quoted is the price you'll pay
- **Honest Advice**: If repair isn't cost-effective, we'll tell you so you can make an informed decision

## What's Included in Your Estimate

When we provide a repair estimate, it includes:

- **Diagnostic Fee**: Covers the technician's time to identify the problem (typically applied toward repair cost)
- **Parts**: All necessary replacement parts, clearly itemized
- **Labour**: Professional installation and repair work
- **Warranty**: 90-day workmanship guarantee on all repairs

## When Repair Makes Sense vs. Replacement

We're committed to giving you honest advice, even if it means recommending replacement over repair. Here's our approach:

**We recommend repair when:**
- The appliance is relatively new or in good condition
- The repair cost is reasonable compared to replacement
- The appliance has many years of useful life remaining
- The issue is a common, fixable problem

**We recommend replacement when:**
- The appliance is very old and near the end of its expected lifespan
- The repair cost approaches or exceeds the value of a new unit
- Multiple major components are failing
- Newer, more efficient models would save you money long-term

When replacement makes more sense, we'll tell you directly and help you understand your options. Our goal is to help you make the best decision for your situation and budget.

## Pricing Factors

Several factors influence repair pricing:

- **Appliance Type**: Different appliances have different complexity levels and parts costs
- **Issue Severity**: Simple fixes cost less than complex repairs
- **Parts Availability**: Common parts are typically less expensive than rare or discontinued components
- **Brand**: Some brands have more expensive parts than others
- **Service Location**: Emergency or after-hours service may include additional fees

We'll explain all of these factors when we provide your estimate so you understand exactly what you're paying for.

## Payment Options

We accept:
- Cash
- Credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express)
- Debit cards

Payment is typically due upon completion of service. For larger repairs or installations, please contact us to discuss payment arrangements.
