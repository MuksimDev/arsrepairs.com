  title: Frequently Asked Questions About Tracking Your Repair
  items:
  - question: How do I track my repair status?
    answer: You can track your repair status by entering your invoice number and house
      number in the form above, or by clicking the secure tracking link provided in
      your service confirmation email. Tracking is available 24/7.
  - question: Where do I find my invoice number and house number?
    answer: Your invoice number is provided on your service receipt and in the email
      we send after your appointment is booked or completed. Your house number is
      simply the street number of the service address (for example, 15 in 15 Connie
      Cres).
  - question: What information can I see when I track my repair?
    answer: You can view the current status of your repair, see important job details,
      and confirm your service address and contact information so everything is accurate
      before your technician arrives.
  - question: Can I change or reschedule my appointment from the tracking page?
    answer: The tracking page is designed to show your current repair status. To change
      or reschedule an appointment, please use our [online booking system](/schedule-service)
      or call us at **866-415-3937**.
  - question: What if I can't access my repair using my invoice number?
    answer: First, double-check that you've entered the invoice number and house number
      exactly as shown on your receipt or in your email. If it still doesn't work,
      call us at **866-415-3937** and our team will help you look it up.
  - question: Is my repair information secure?
    answer: Yes. Your repair details are only accessible using your unique invoice
      number and house number or the secure link we send to your email. We do not
      share your personal or service information with third parties.
