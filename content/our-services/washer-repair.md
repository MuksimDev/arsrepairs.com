  title: Frequently Asked Questions About Washer Repair
  items:
  - question: Why is my washing machine not spinning?
    answer: Spin issues often come from a bad lid switch, worn drive belt, failed
      motor, or control fault. An unbalanced load can also stop the spin. Our technicians
      test each part and restore a full spin cycle.
  - question: My washer is leaking - what should I do?
    answer: Stop the cycle, unplug the washer, and turn off the water taps if you
      can. Leaks usually come from hoses, pumps, tubs, or door seals. We trace the
      source, replace the failed part, and check for water damage risks.
  - question: How much does washing machine repair cost?
    answer: Cost depends on the fault and parts needed. Hoses, valves, and minor electrical
      issues are usually lower cost. Motors, bearings, and control boards cost more.
      We give a clear written quote after diagnosis, before any work.
  - question: Can you repair front-load and top-load washers?
    answer: Yes. We repair front load, top load, high efficiency, and traditional
      machines. Our team works with Samsung, LG, Whirlpool, GE, Maytag, and most other
      major washer brands across Ontario.
  - question: My washer is making loud noises - is this normal?
    answer: No. Loud banging, grinding, or humming often means worn bearings, loose
      parts, broken shocks, or foreign objects in the drum or pump. It is best to
      stop using the machine and have it checked to prevent bigger damage.
  - question: How long does washer repair take?
    answer: Most repairs finish in a single visit. Simple fixes can take under an
      hour. Larger jobs with parts replacement can take a few hours. At the end of
      diagnosis, we explain the plan and expected time on site.

A washer problem can stop laundry for a whole home. {{< company-name >}} services front load and top load washers across Toronto, the GTA, and many Ontario cities. We repair brands such as Samsung, LG, Whirlpool, GE, Maytag, Electrolux, Bosch, and more.

Our technicians track down leaks, spin faults, drain issues, and error codes with proper test tools and clear steps.

We work on stacked sets, laundry closets, basement laundry rooms, and shared laundry spaces. From mild vibration to a dead washer, we provide repair with parts and labour backed by warranty.

## Why Timely Washer Repair Is Important

Washers move water, power, and high speed parts in a tight space. When they fail, you can see leaks, noise, and heavy wear on drums, bearings, and motors. Waiting too long can lead to floor damage, mold, and higher repair cost.

Our technicians check water flow, drain rate, drum support, and electronic control. A well repaired washer will:

{{< list >}}
Spin and drain clothes fully
Use the right amount of water and power
Run with low noise and limited vibration
Protect floors and nearby finishes from leaks

## Common Washer Issues We Fix

Washers depend on water valves, pumps, motors, shocks, sensors, and controls. A fault in any area can show up as bad wash results, noise, or standing water.
