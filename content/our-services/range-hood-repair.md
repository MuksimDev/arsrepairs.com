  title: Frequently Asked Questions About Range Hood Repair
  items:
  - question: Why is my range hood fan not working?
    answer: Fan problems often come from a burnt motor, seized blower wheel, faulty
      switch, or wiring issues. We test each component and restore proper airflow.
  - question: How much does range hood repair cost?
    answer: Costs depend on the part and the repair. Switches and bulbs are lower
      cost. Motors and control boards cost more. We provide a clear flat-rate quote
      before work begins.
  - question: Can you repair all range hood types?
    answer: Yes. We repair ducted, ductless, under-cabinet, wall-mounted, island,
      and professional-grade systems for all major brands.
  - question: My range hood lights stopped working. Can you fix them?
    answer: Yes. We repair lighting circuits, switches, wiring, and replace LED or
      halogen bulbs depending on your hood's design.
  - question: Why is my range hood so loud?
    answer: Noise often comes from a failing motor, obstructed blower wheel, loose
      panels, or poor duct airflow. We find and correct the cause.
  - question: Do you install range hoods?
    answer: Yes. We install ducted and ductless models, complete venting work, and
      perform final safety and airflow checks.

## Why Timely Range Hood Repair Is Important

Range hoods keep air clean and remove smoke, steam, and cooking odors. When the fan weakens, lights fail, or the hood becomes loud, ventilation drops and cooking becomes difficult. {{< company-name >}} repairs all major range hood brands and styles across Toronto, the GTA, and many Ontario communities.

We service ducted and ductless systems, under-cabinet hoods, wall-mounted chimney hoods, island hoods, and custom insert hoods. From weak airflow to complete fan failure, our technicians provide clear diagnosis and warranty backed repair.

A range hood must pull air smoothly to remove grease, smoke, and heat. When the motor weakens or ducts block, air recirculates and buildup begins. Fast repair reduces strain on the motor, improves airflow, and prevents electrical or overheating issues.

Our technicians test fan speed, verify airflow, inspect wiring, and check duct balance. A properly repaired hood will:

Improve ventilation and smoke removal
Reduce kitchen heat and lingering odors
Run quietly with steady airflow
Protect the motor from strain and early failure

## Common Range Hood Issues We Fix

Range hoods rely on motors, switches, lights, and ductwork working together. When one part fails, performance drops. We repair issues such as:

{{< list >}}
Fan not turning on or turning slowly
Weak or uneven airflow
Loud humming, rattling, or vibration
Lights not working or flickering
Burnt motors or damaged switches
Loose filters, covers, or panels
Control boards not responding
Duct blockages or airflow restriction
{{< /list >}}

Prompt service restores ventilation and prevents further damage.

## Why Range Hoods Malfunction

Common causes include:

{{< list >}}
Worn or burnt-out fan motors
