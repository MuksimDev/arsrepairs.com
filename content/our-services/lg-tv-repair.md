  title: Frequently Asked Questions About LG TV Repair
  items:
  - question: Can you repair LG TVs with no picture but sound?
    answer: Yes. This issue is often caused by a failed backlight, loose ribbon cables,
      or a damaged display driver board. We test each part and restore the panel whenever
      possible.
  - question: Can you fix LG TVs that will not turn on?
    answer: Yes. Power faults may come from damaged power supply boards, bad capacitors,
      faulty wiring, or mainboard issues. We check all power stages and confirm the
      cause.
  - question: Do you repair LG OLED, QNED, NanoCell, and LED TVs?
    answer: Yes. We service all LG television types including OLED, QLED, QNED, NanoCell,
      LED, and older LCD models.
  - question: Is it worth repairing an LG TV?
    answer: Many repairs are cost effective. Backlight repair, board replacement,
      and power system repair are often more affordable than a new TV. We give you
      an honest quote before any work begins.
  - question: Do you repair sound issues and HDMI problems?
    answer: Yes. We fix sound loss, crackling audio, HDMI ports that stop working,
      and TVs that disconnect from devices. We also repair WiFi and Bluetooth issues.
  - question: Do you repair commercial LG displays?
    answer: Yes. We service digital menu boards, store displays, office screens, and
      hotel televisions. We offer flexible scheduling for commercial locations.

## Professional LG TV Repair for Homes and Businesses
A TV is at the center of many homes. When the screen goes black or the sound cuts out, it interrupts your day. Our team repairs LG TVs across Toronto, the GTA, and many Ontario cities. We work on OLED, QNED, NanoCell, LED, LCD, and commercial displays.

We test the full system. This includes power boards, backlights, display signals, HDMI ports, and software. Most repairs are completed in one visit. You get clear results and stable performance.

## Why Timely LG TV Repair Matters

Small TV issues can grow over time. A faint screen can turn into a full backlight failure. A loose HDMI port can break the internal mount. A delayed power start can indicate a failing capacitor.

Fixing problems early helps prevent further damage and restores picture and sound quality.

A proper LG TV repair will:
