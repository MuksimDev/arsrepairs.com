  title: Frequently Asked Questions About Refrigerator Repair
  items:
  - question: Why is my refrigerator not cooling?
    answer: Cooling problems often come from a weak compressor, blocked coils, failed
      fans, or sealed system issues. We test each component to confirm the cause and
      restore proper cooling.
  - question: How much does refrigerator repair cost?
    answer: Cost depends on the fault and parts required. Door gaskets and sensors
      are usually lower cost. Compressors and control boards are more. We provide
      a full diagnosis and a clear written quote before work begins.
  - question: Can you repair all refrigerator brands?
    answer: Yes. We repair Samsung, LG, Whirlpool, GE, Frigidaire, KitchenAid, Maytag,
      and many other brands found in Ontario homes.
  - question: My ice maker is not working. What could be wrong?
    answer: Ice maker faults often involve frozen lines, worn valves, faulty heater
      strips, or a failed ice maker assembly. We trace the cause and restore ice production.
  - question: Is it worth repairing an old refrigerator?
    answer: Often yes, especially for newer units or premium models. We assess age,
      condition, and repair cost so you can make the right choice.
  - question: How long does refrigerator repair take?
    answer: Many repairs are completed on the first visit. Simple work may take under
      an hour. More complex sealed system work takes longer. We provide timing once
      we diagnose the problem.

A fridge that cannot hold temperature risks food spoilage, leaks, frost buildup, and compressor strain. {{< company-name >}} services all major refrigerator brands across Ontario for homes, condos, rentals, and small commercial kitchens.

We repair French door, side by side, bottom freezer, top freezer, compact, and built in units. Whether the fridge runs warm, leaks water, makes noise, or stops running, our technicians diagnose the fault and restore proper cooling with warranty backed repair.

## Why Timely Refrigerator Repair Is Important

Refrigerators run around the clock. When cooling drops or airflow weakens, food spoils faster and internal parts work harder. Quick repair prevents compressor damage, reduces power consumption, and avoids moisture problems inside the cabinet.

Our technicians verify temperature accuracy, test sensors and controls, check fan and airflow performance, and confirm sealed system operation. A properly repaired refrigerator will:

{{< list >}}
Maintain stable temperatures in both compartments
Reduce frost, leaks, and moisture buildup
Run more quietly and with less vibration
Protect food safety and shelf life
{{< /list >}}

## Common Refrigerator Issues We Fix

A refrigerator depends on cooling, airflow, and electronic controls working together. When one part weakens, symptoms appear. We fix problems such as:

{{< list >}}
Warm or unstable temperatures
Freezer cold but fridge warm
Ice maker not producing or leaking
Frost on back panel or heavy ice buildup
Water dripping inside or onto floor
Noisy fans or vibrating panels
Control panel not responding
Doors not sealing or gaskets damaged
Water dispenser slow or not working
{{< /list >}}

Prompt service protects the compressor, maintains proper cooling, and prevents bigger failures.

## Why Refrigerators Malfunction

Common causes include:

{{< list >}}
Dirty condenser coils reducing heat removal
Worn evaporator or condenser fan motors
Faulty sensors, thermostats, or control boards
Damaged door gaskets letting warm air inside
Clogged defrost drains causing leaks
Low refrigerant or compressor failure in the sealed system
{{< /list >}}

We find the exact failure, explain the cause, and review repair options before work begins.
