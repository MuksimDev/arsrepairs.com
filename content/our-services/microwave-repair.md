  title: Frequently Asked Questions About Microwave Repair
  items:
  - question: Why is my microwave not heating food?
    answer: Heating failures are usually caused by a weak magnetron, faulty high-voltage
      diode, bad capacitor, or transformer issues. These high-voltage parts require
      proper testing and professional replacement.
  - question: Is it worth repairing a microwave or should I replace it?
    answer: If the unit is built-in, over-the-range, or part of a matching set, repair
      is often more cost-effective than replacement. We assess the age, condition,
      and repair cost and give you a clear recommendation.
  - question: How much does microwave repair cost?
    answer: Costs depend on the fault and parts required. Door switches and fuses
      are usually on the lower end, while magnetron or control board repairs cost
      more. You receive a flat-rate estimate before any work begins.
  - question: Can you repair over-the-range and built-in microwaves?
    answer: Yes. We repair countertop, built-in, and over-the-range microwaves from
      major brands including GE, Whirlpool, Samsung, LG, Panasonic, Frigidaire, and
      more.
  - question: My microwave door won't close properly – can you fix it?
    answer: Yes. Door problems are often caused by worn latches, bent hinges, or failed
      door switches. We repair these issues so the door seals correctly and the safety
      interlocks work as designed.
  - question: Is it safe to use a microwave that's sparking?
    answer: No. Sparking can indicate a damaged waveguide cover, exposed metal, or
      high-voltage failure. Stop using the unit and schedule service to prevent further
      damage or safety risks.

Microwave problems are more than an inconvenience. No-heat issues, sparking, or a door that will not latch can point to serious electrical or safety faults. {{< company-name >}} {{< geolocation >}} repairs all major microwave brands used in homes, condos, rental units, staff kitchens, and small commercial spaces.

We service countertop units, built-in models, and over-the-range microwaves. If your microwave is not heating or shuts off mid-cycle, our technicians can help. We also fix loud noises, error codes, and other issues. Our goal is to find the cause and restore safe, reliable operation.

## Why Timely Microwave Repair Matters

Microwaves rely on high-voltage parts, safety switches, and control boards that must work together. When one part starts to fail, stress is placed on the rest of the system. Waiting too long can turn a simple repair into a full component failure.

A properly repaired microwave will:

{{< list >}}
Heat food evenly without cold spots
Run without sparks, burning smells, or arcing
Keep the door and safety switches working correctly
Operate without shutting down mid-cycle
Work quietly at normal fan and motor levels
{{< /list >}}

## Why Microwaves Malfunction

Over time, heat, moisture, and repeated door use wear down internal components. Electrical parts can weaken, safety switches can go out of alignment, and moving parts can fail.

Common causes include:

{{< list >}}
Weak or failed magnetron
Faulty high-voltage diode, capacitor, or transformer
Broken or misaligned door switches and latches
Turntable motor or drive coupler wear
Control panel, keypad, or display failures
Damaged waveguide cover or interior arcing
Cooling or airflow problems inside the cabinet
{{< /list >}}

We test each system carefully and explain what failed, why it happened, and the best repair option before any work begins.

## Common Microwave Issues We Fix

{{< list >}}
Microwave runs but does not heat
Sparking or arcing inside the cavity
Door will not close or unit will not start
Turntable not rotating or turning unevenly
Buttons not responding or display not working
Microwave shuts off during or shortly after start
Loud humming, buzzing, or grinding noises
Burning smells, hot cabinet, or tripped breaker
Error codes or intermittent power issues
{{< /list >}}

If you notice any of these symptoms, stop using the microwave and schedule service to prevent further damage.
