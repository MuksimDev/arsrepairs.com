  title: Frequently Asked Questions About Computer Monitor Repair
  items:
  - question: Can you fix flickering or dim screens?
    answer: Yes. We repair flickering screens, dim backlights, and brightness problems.
      These issues often come from loose connections, weak backlights, failing capacitors,
      or software faults. We check the full display system before repair.
  - question: How much does computer monitor repair cost?
    answer: Cost depends on the fault and the type of monitor. Simple internal repairs
      cost less than full backlight or board work. You receive a clear quote after
      diagnosis.
  - question: Do you repair HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB ports?
    answer: Yes. We repair loose, damaged, or non responsive ports. Many port failures
      are caused by worn connectors or cracked solder joints. We restore secure connection
      and signal quality.
  - question: Can you repair dead pixels or lines on the screen?
    answer: Some dead pixels and light pressure marks can be reduced. Lines on the
      screen often come from ribbon cable faults or failed internal boards. We inspect
      the panel and advise you on what can be restored.
  - question: Is repair better than replacing the monitor?
    answer: Repair is often the better choice when the frame, panel, and boards are
      still in good condition. When the panel is cracked or burned, replacement may
      be cheaper. We tell you the best option after inspection.
  - question: Do you repair commercial and office monitors?
    answer: Yes. We repair desktop monitors used in offices, retail spaces, call centers,
      schools, and production areas. We help reduce downtime with flexible scheduling.
