  title: Frequently Asked Questions About Vacuum Repair
  items:
  - question: Can you fix vacuums that have lost suction?
    answer: Yes. Suction loss often comes from blockages, worn belts, damaged hoses,
      weak motors, or clogged filters. We test the full airflow system and restore
      proper suction.
  - question: How much does vacuum repair cost?
    answer: Cost depends on the model and the fault. Simple fixes like belts or clogs
      cost less. Motor repairs or power faults cost more. You receive a full quote
      after diagnosis.
  - question: Do you repair upright, canister, and cordless vacuums?
    answer: Yes. We repair many vacuum types. This includes upright units, canister
      vacuums, stick vacuums, central vac attachments, and commercial floor machines.
  - question: Can you repair vacuum motors?
    answer: Many motor issues can be repaired. Some require replacement. We check
      brushes, wiring, bearings, and airflow to confirm the best option.
  - question: Do you repair blocked or broken hoses?
    answer: Yes. We clear clogs and replace hoses that have tears or leaks. A damaged
      hose reduces suction and forces the motor to work harder.
  - question: Do you fix commercial vacuum cleaners?
    answer: Yes. We repair restaurant vacuums, janitorial units, shop vacuums, office
      vacuums, and other high use models. We offer flexible scheduling for busy locations.

## Professional Vacuum Repair for Homes and Businesses
A vacuum works hard every day. Dust, hair, dirt, and clogged filters can slowly weaken its power. Our team repairs many types of vacuums across Toronto, the GTA, and nearby Ontario cities. We service upright vacuums, canister models, central vac attachments, stick vacuums, and commercial units.

We clean, test, and repair airflow systems using tools made for safe vacuum service. Many repairs are finished in one visit. You get stronger suction and better cleaning performance.

## Why Timely Vacuum Repair Matters

Small vacuum problems can grow fast. A clogged filter can burn out a motor. A worn belt can damage the brush roll. A loose hose can make the vacuum run louder and hotter. Early repair keeps parts safe and restores strong suction.

Our technicians inspect the vacuum, check airflow, test the motor, and confirm power stability. A proper repair will:

Restore full suction and airflow

Reduce noise and overheating
Prevent clogs from forming again
Extend the life of the vacuum
