  title: Frequently Asked Questions About Dryer Repair
  items:
  - question: Why is my dryer not heating?
    answer: Dryer heating failures are often caused by a bad heating element, igniter,
      thermal fuse, thermostat, or gas valve. We diagnose gas and electric models
      and restore proper heat safely.
  - question: How much does dryer repair cost?
    answer: Costs depend on the fault. Fuses and switches are affordable. Motors,
      elements, or control boards cost more. We provide a clear, flat-rate estimate
      before any work begins.
  - question: Can you repair both gas and electric dryers?
    answer: Yes. Our technicians are licensed gas fitters and trained to repair all
      major gas and electric dryer brands.
  - question: My dryer takes too long to dry, what’s wrong?
    answer: Slow drying usually means a clogged vent, weak heating element, or restricted
      airflow. We check the vent path, drum temperature, and internal airflow to find
      the cause.
  - question: Is it safe to use a dryer that’s not heating properly?
    answer: A dryer with poor heating may still run, but hidden faults can worsen.
      Service helps prevent further wear and ensures safe operation.
  - question: How often should I clean my dryer vent?
    answer: At least once per year. Heavy use or long vent runs may need more frequent
      cleaning. Clear vents reduce fire risk and improve performance.

A dryer that stops heating or takes too long to dry adds time, energy waste, and safety concerns. {{< company-name >}} {{< geolocation >}} repairs all major dryer brands across Ontario, including gas and electric units in homes, condos, and rental buildings.

We diagnose heating problems, airflow issues, drum failures, noise, and electrical faults to restore safe and efficient drying. Our technicians carry common dryer parts and follow proven testing methods to ensure proper heat, airflow, and rotation.

## Why Timely Dryer Repair Is Important

Dryers generate heat and rely on steady airflow. When either system fails, clothes stay damp, the unit overheats, and the vent can become a fire hazard. Early repair keeps your dryer running safely and prevents larger failures.

A properly repaired dryer will:

{{< list >}}
Heat consistently for fast drying
Run with smooth drum rotation and minimal noise
Maintain clear airflow without blockages
Reduce energy use and drying times
Operate safely with correct temperature control
{{< /list >}}

## Why Dryers Malfunction

Dryers use heating elements, fuses, motors, sensors, and ventilation components that must work together. When airflow drops or a part weakens, heat becomes unstable and performance declines.

Common causes include:

{{< list >}}
Clogged or restricted dryer vents
Failed heating element or igniter
Worn rollers, bearings, or belts
Faulty thermostats or thermal fuses
Control board or timer failures
Damaged or weak drum motor
Blocked lint passages inside the machine
{{< /list >}}

We inspect the full heating and airflow system to find the exact fault.

## Common Dryer Issues We Fix

{{< list >}}
Dryer not heating
Takes too long to dry
Drum not spinning or noisy
Burning smells or overheating
Vent blockage or poor airflow
Gas ignition failure
Thermal fuse or thermostat failure
Control panel, timer, or button problems
{{< /list >}}

If these symptoms appear, service helps prevent further wear and safety risks.
