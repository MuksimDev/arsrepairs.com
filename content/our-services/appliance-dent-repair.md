  title: Frequently Asked Questions About Appliance Dent Repair
  items:
  - question: Can you remove dents from stainless steel appliances?
    answer: Yes. We repair dents on most stainless steel appliances using tools that
      lift and smooth the metal without heat or paint. Results depend on how deep
      the dent is and if the metal is stretched. We assess the panel first and tell
      you what can be restored.
  - question: How much does appliance dent repair cost?
    answer: Cost depends on the size and depth of the dent, the type of metal, and
      the location. Small dents near flat sections cost less than deep dents on curved
      areas. You receive a full quote after inspection with no hidden fees.
  - question: Can you repair dents on doors and side panels?
    answer: Yes. We repair dents on appliance doors, side panels, and lower access
      panels. Some panel types can be smoothed on site. Others may need light refinishing
      or part replacement if the damage is severe.
  - question: Do you repair scratches and scuff marks?
    answer: Many light scratches can be removed or reduced. We use cleaning pads,
      stainless polishing compounds, and finish-safe tools to restore the surface.
      Deep scratches may not come out fully but can often be improved.
  - question: Is dent repair better than replacing the panel?
    answer: Dent repair is often easier and more affordable than replacing a full
      door or panel. Replacement is only needed when dents are very deep or when the
      metal is creased. We tell you the best option after we inspect the appliance.
  - question: Do you repair cosmetic damage on commercial appliances?
    answer: Yes. We repair dents and marks on appliances used in restaurants, bars,
      offices, and retail spaces. We work around your schedule to reduce downtime.

Dents can make an appliance look old even when it still works well. Our team repairs dents on many types of home and commercial appliances across Toronto, the GTA, and surrounding Ontario cities. We work on refrigerators, dishwashers, dryers, washers, freezers, microwave doors, and more.

We use safe tools that lift and reshape the metal without heat or harsh chemicals. Many repairs can be done in one visit. You get clear results that improve the look and value of your appliance.

## Why Timely Appliance Dent Repair Matters

Dents weaken the metal over time. They can cause door seals to sit unevenly or allow moisture to enter seams. Sharp dents can also catch on clothing or create cleaning problems. Fixing them early helps protect the appliance body and keeps the surface smooth and safe.

Our technicians check the dent, confirm if the metal is stretched, and repair the damaged area using tools made for stainless and painted panels. A proper repair will:

{{< list >}}
Improve the look of the appliance
Remove or reduce visible dents and creases
Help doors seal and close the right way
Keep surfaces smooth and easier to clean
Prevent small dents from turning into cracks or bends
