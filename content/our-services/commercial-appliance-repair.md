  title: Frequently Asked Questions About Commercial Appliance Repair
  items:
  - question: Do you offer priority service for commercial clients?
    answer: Yes. Commercial clients can enroll in priority service level agreements
      (SLAs) that include guaranteed response times and dedicated scheduling. Restaurants
      and hospitality businesses receive faster dispatch for critical failures.
  - question: What types of commercial equipment do you service?
    answer: We repair commercial ovens, ranges, dishwashers, refrigeration, freezers,
      ice machines, prep coolers, and commercial laundry equipment. We also service
      retail refrigeration and light-commercial cooking equipment.
  - question: Do you offer preventative maintenance programs?
    answer: Yes. Preventative maintenance programs reduce downtime, extend equipment
      lifespan, and keep kitchens compliant. Programs include scheduled cleaning,
      inspections, testing, and replacement of wear components.
  - question: Do you provide volume discounts for multiple locations?
    answer: Yes. We offer volume pricing, national account support, and tailored service
      agreements for multi-location businesses and property management groups.
  - question: What are your emergency response times for commercial clients?
    answer: We provide emergency service. Priority clients typically receive a technician
      within 2–4 hours depending on location and equipment type.
  - question: Do you provide detailed service reports?
    answer: Yes. Every visit includes documented service reports, maintenance logs,
      and recommendations. These help clients track equipment history and plan future
      repairs or replacements.
