  title: Frequently Asked Questions About Stove & Cooktop Repair
  items:
  - question: Why won't my gas stove burners light?
    answer: Most ignition faults come from weak igniters, blocked burner ports, or
      gas valve issues. Our licensed gas fitters clean, test, and replace the parts
      needed so burners light quickly and safely.
  - question: How much does cooktop repair cost?
    answer: Cost depends on the fault, brand, and parts required. Igniters and switches
      are often lower cost. Control boards, glass tops, or complex gas parts are higher.
      We diagnose first and give a clear written quote before any repair.
  - question: Can you repair induction cooktops?
    answer: Yes. We repair gas, electric, and induction cooktops. For induction, we
      test power boards, sensors, and coils to solve pan detection faults, error codes,
      and heating issues.
  - question: My electric cooktop burner won't heat - what's wrong?
    answer: This is often a failed element, switch, or wiring contact. We test the
      circuit, find the open or shorted part, and replace what is needed to restore
      even heat.
  - question: Is it safe to use a gas stove that won't light?
    answer: No. Unlit gas can build up and create a safety risk. Turn the burner off,
      ventilate the area, and avoid using the stove until it is checked. Our licensed
      gas fitters can test for leaks and repair the ignition safely.
  - question: Can you repair built-in cooktops?
    answer: Yes. We service freestanding stoves, slide in ranges, and built in cooktops.
      We remove the unit as needed, repair it, and then set it back in place with
      proper clearances and secure connections.

A failed burner or control problem can stop meal prep and raise safety concerns. {{< company-name >}} repairs gas, electric, and induction stoves and cooktops in homes, condos, rentals, and light commercial kitchens across Ontario.

We service brands such as GE, Whirlpool, Frigidaire, Samsung, LG, Bosch, KitchenAid, Maytag, and many more.

Our technicians track down ignition faults, heating issues, and control failures with proper test tools and clear steps. From one dead burner to a full range that will not heat, we focus on safe repair and stable performance.

## Why Timely Stove and Cooktop Repair Is Important

Cooking appliances combine gas or high voltage power with heat, flame, and sensitive controls. When appliances do not work properly, risks arise. These include uneven cooking and damage to cookware. In more serious cases, fire or gas hazards can occur. Quick service helps prevent these issues and protects wiring, valves, and glass tops from further damage.

A properly repaired stove or cooktop will:

{{< list >}}
Light burners fast and with a steady flame
Heat elements and zones evenly
Respond correctly to temperature changes
Shut off and cool down as expected
Operate without unusual smells, noises, or error codes
{{< /list >}}

## Common Stove and Cooktop Issues We Fix

Problems can come from burners, elements, spark systems, sensors, or control boards. Small faults often grow if the appliance keeps running in a weak state.

Common issues we see include:

{{< list >}}
Gas burners that will not light or keep clicking
Uneven or lazy flames on gas burners
Electric elements that do not heat or stay on too low
Induction zones that do not detect pans or show error codes
Cooktop glass that is cracked or scorched
Knobs that do not respond or feel loose
Rear of the range or control panel feeling too hot
Smell of gas, burning plastic, or hot wiring
Tripped breakers when using the oven and top together
{{< /list >}}

Our technicians test gas pressure where needed, check wiring and connectors, and confirm that controls and safety devices work as designed.
