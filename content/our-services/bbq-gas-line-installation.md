  title: Frequently Asked Questions About BBQ Gas Line Installation
  items:
  - question: Do I need a licensed technician for BBQ gas line installation?
    answer: Yes. Gas line work must be done by a licensed technician. This ensures
      proper installation, safety checks, leak testing, and compliance with local
      codes.
  - question: Can you install a natural gas line for my existing BBQ?
    answer: Yes. We install new natural gas lines, extend current lines, and add shutoff
      valves. We can also convert some propane grills to natural gas when approved
      by the manufacturer.
  - question: Is natural gas better than propane for a BBQ?
    answer: Many homeowners choose natural gas because it is convenient and does not
      require tank refills. Propane is also a good choice for portable grills. Both
      work well when installed correctly.
  - question: How long does installation take?
    answer: Most BBQ gas line installations take one to two hours. Timing depends
      on distance from the main supply and the layout of your outdoor space.
  - question: Do you test the gas line after installation?
    answer: Yes. We complete full leak testing, pressure checks, and ignition checks
      before the BBQ is used.
  - question: Can you install gas lines for outdoor kitchens?
    answer: Yes. We install lines for built in grills, outdoor stovetops, side burners,
      and patio heaters. We can run lines through decks, patios, and finished outdoor
      structures.
