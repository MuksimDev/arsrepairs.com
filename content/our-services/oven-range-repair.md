  title: Frequently Asked Questions About Oven & Range Repair
  items:
  - question: Why is my oven not heating?
    answer: Heating failures often come from a weak element, failed igniter, faulty
      temperature sensor, or a damaged control board. We test each part and restore
      proper heating.
  - question: How much does oven repair cost?
    answer: Costs vary by part. Elements and igniters are simpler repairs. Control
      boards and gas valves cost more. You receive a flat-rate estimate before any
      work begins.
  - question: Can you repair both gas and electric ranges?
    answer: Yes. Our technicians repair gas and electric models and are licensed to
      work on all major brands across Ontario.
  - question: My oven temperature is inaccurate. Can you fix it?
    answer: Yes. We test and recalibrate temperature sensors, replace faulty sensors,
      and check control accuracy for stable, even cooking.
  - question: Is it safe to use a gas range that will not light?
    answer: No. Ignition problems can indicate gas flow or safety issues. Stop using
      the appliance and call us for diagnosis.
  - question: How long does range repair take?
    answer: Most repairs finish on the first visit. Simple repairs take one to two
      hours. Complex repairs may take longer depending on parts.

A failing oven or range can disrupt meals and create safety concerns. {{< company-name >}} repairs all major oven and range brands across Toronto, the GTA, and many Ontario regions. We service gas and electric models, single and double ovens, slide-in and freestanding ranges, induction surfaces, and built-in wall ovens.

If your oven is not heating, cooking unevenly, or showing error codes, our technicians provide accurate diagnosis and repair backed by warranty.

## Why Timely Oven & Range Repair Is Important

Ovens and ranges depend on stable heat, working igniters, and accurate controls. When any component fails, cooking performance drops and safety risks increase. Quick repair prevents further wear, reduces heat loss, and protects electrical and gas systems.

Our technicians test ignition, element output, sensors, airflow, and control accuracy. A properly repaired oven or range will:

{{< list >}}
Heat evenly and reach the correct temperature
Ignite safely and reliably
Cook food without hot spots
Operate quietly with stable controls
{{< /list >}}

## Common Oven & Range Issues We Fix

We repair a wide range of issues on gas and electric models:

{{< list >}}
Oven not heating or heating too slowly
Inaccurate temperature or uneven cooking
Burners not lighting or heating
Igniter failures and gas flow issues
Element failures and wiring faults
Control panel or display malfunctions
Broiler not working
Door not closing or sealing
Error codes and shutdowns
{{< /list >}}

If you notice weak heat, long preheat times, or ignition problems, early service can prevent safety risks.

## Why Ovens & Ranges Malfunction

Ovens and ranges rely on ignition systems, sensors, elements, and controls. As components wear or wiring weakens, performance declines.

Common causes include:

{{< list >}}
Failed heating elements or igniters
Damaged or misreading temperature sensors
Faulty gas valves or electronic controls
Loose wiring or burnt connectors
Worn gaskets that leak heat
Defective control boards or switches
{{< /list >}}

We pinpoint the exact fault and explain repair options before work begins.
