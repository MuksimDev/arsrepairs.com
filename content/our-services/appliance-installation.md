  title: Frequently Asked Questions About Appliance Installation
  items:
  - question: Do you install all types of appliances?
    answer: Yes. We install fridges, dishwashers, washers, dryers, ranges, ovens,
      cooktops, range hoods, microwaves, and wine coolers. We work on freestanding,
      built-in, and specialty models.
  - question: Are your installers licensed?
    answer: Yes. Our installation technicians include licensed gas fitters and certified
      electricians. All work is done to Ontario building codes with proper safety
      checks.
  - question: What does installation include?
    answer: Installation includes correct water, electrical, and gas connections,
      leveling, anchoring (when needed), safety checks, full performance testing,
      and cleanup of packaging.
  - question: How much does appliance installation cost?
    answer: Costs depend on the appliance type and complexity. Basic installations
      are lower in cost, while built-ins or gas appliances require more time. We provide
      clear estimates before work begins.
  - question: Do you remove old appliances?
    answer: Yes. We can remove and dispose of old appliances at the same visit. This
      ensures the new unit fits properly and the old unit is handled safely.

    answer: All installations include a 90-day workmanship guarantee. If an issue
      arises due to installation, we fix it at no charge.
