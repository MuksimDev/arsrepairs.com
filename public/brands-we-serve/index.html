LG warranty also did not supply the repair company with my cell or proof of age of the fridge. So the ticket was cancelled. Spoke with Gila first thing Friday morning. Dealt with LG service again. Gila made magic happen. She got a technician to come out on a Friday afternoon between other calls to fix my fridge. A mental lifesaver for me, especially having had to listen to the incessant beep every 30 seconds, 24 hours a day. Thank you to the techs. But big thanks to Gila for fitting me in and understanding the necessity. This is the service that AI can never provide; the personal touch makes the difference.\"",

I truly recommend these people. Again, I thank Taranveer for his great personality and high-quality work. Please share this with him as he deserves it. Thank you.\"",

An ARS technician (Daniel) attended. We THOUGHT that it was fixed when Daniel left. However, there was another issue. We called ARS. The dispatcher connected us with Daniel. He had another job after ours but returned well after hours, on the Easter weekend, to ensure that our new fridge was repaired. We are very appreciative of Daniel's dedication and integrity to ensure that we have a working appliance. We would definitely recommend ARS and Daniel for any frustrations involving appliances!\"",

After 5 years of problems and service to this LG fridge, it was all a waste of time and large monies. The issue with the fridge could have been resolved a couple of years ago. But Northern staff obviously had a different agenda. I will request ARS in the future. But hope this is the last time an appliance in my home will have to be serviced!\"",

After multiple complaints to Samsung and multiple companies coming to my house wasting my time. They just thawed it out and said it's a design flaw. I almost gave up. Then I gave it one more chance. ARS was the company that came and finally solved my problem. The technician was super nice. You could tell he knew what he was doing. The ice maker has never worked better, no more freezing!!!!!! Thanks, ARS; you did an awesome job.\"",

                  <p>Amazing service. This Samsung fridge has had an issue with the ice maker since I bought it. After multiple complaints to Samsung and multiple companies coming to my house wasting my time. They just thawed it out and said it&#39;s a design flaw. I almost gave up. Then I gave it one more chance. ARS was the company that came and finally solved my problem. The technician was super nice. You could tell he knew what he was doing. The ice maker has never worked better, no more freezing!!!!!! Thanks, ARS; you did an awesome job.</p>

                  <p>Thank you for great service. The issue was with the Samsung ice maker. Then more issues were added. Everything was broken. Basically, the fridge and freezer warmed up. So after a few times fixing and figuring out what&#39;s wrong with it, everything works perfectly now. Thanks to the knowledgeable technician.</p>

                  <p>The ARS technician Qaiser was friendly and very knowledgeable. He came to assess my washing machine. He asked a lot of questions to help him understand the issue. He stayed for a full spin cycle to make sure I knew what the problem was. This left me feeling very confident that it was fixed. He shared good advice too. I will call ARS again and ask for Qaiser in the future. I have already recommended him to family.</p>

                  <p>What great customer service! We had an issue with ice forming in our Samsung fridge since the water was not draining out as it should. We reached out to Samsung Canada to resolve the issue. Samsung Canada referred us to ARS. We are so glad they did. They promptly scheduled an appointment. Andre, the technician, did a great job. He arrived on time. He finished the work promptly. He also shared some tips to keep the fridge working efficiently. The issue was resolved. The fridge is working properly. We&#39;re very happy and thankful for the great service.</p>

                  <p>The tech that arrived to service my fridge was friendly and professional. He efficiently diagnosed the issue. The best part was they had the part on hand. They were able to complete the repair in one visit. The tracking system to see where in line you are for that day&#39;s service calls is a very helpful feature. It allowed me to minimize the time spent waiting for the technician to arrive. Overall, I would highly recommend ARS.</p>

              <p>Amazing service. This Samsung fridge has had an issue with the ice maker since I bought it. After multiple complaints to Samsung and multiple companies coming to my house wasting my time. They just thawed it out and said it&#39;s a design flaw. I almost gave up. Then I gave it one more chance. ARS was the company that came and finally solved my problem. The technician was super nice. You could tell he knew what he was doing. The ice maker has never worked better, no more freezing!!!!!! Thanks, ARS; you did an awesome job.</p>

              <p>Thank you for great service. The issue was with the Samsung ice maker. Then more issues were added. Everything was broken. Basically, the fridge and freezer warmed up. So after a few times fixing and figuring out what&#39;s wrong with it, everything works perfectly now. Thanks to the knowledgeable technician.</p>

He stayed for a full spin cycle to make sure I knew what the problem was. This left me feeling very confident that it was fixed. He shared good advice too. I will call ARS again and ask for Qaiser in the future. I have already recommended him to family.</p>

              <p>What great customer service! We had an issue with ice forming in our Samsung fridge since the water was not draining out as it should. We reached out to Samsung Canada to resolve the issue. Samsung Canada referred us to ARS. We are so glad they did. They promptly scheduled an appointment. Andre, the technician, did a great job. He arrived on time. He finished the work promptly. He also shared some tips to keep the fridge working efficiently. The issue was resolved. The fridge is working properly. We&#39;re very happy and thankful for the great service.</p>

They were able to complete the repair in one visit. The tracking system to see where in line you are for that day&#39;s service calls is a very helpful feature. It allowed me to minimize the time spent waiting for the technician to arrive. Overall, I would highly recommend ARS.</p>
