So I called LG warranty on Tuesday. They said someone would come on Friday. They could not tell me the name of the company, though. LG warranty also did not supply the repair company with my cell or proof of age of the fridge. So the ticket was cancelled. Spoke with Gila first thing Friday morning. Dealt with LG service again. Gila made magic happen. She got a technician to come out on a Friday afternoon between other calls to fix my fridge. A mental lifesaver for me, especially having had to listen to the incessant beep every 30 seconds, 24 hours a day. Thank you to the techs. But big thanks to Gila for fitting me in and understanding the necessity. This is the service that AI can never provide; the personal touch makes the difference.\"",

An ARS technician (Daniel) attended. We THOUGHT that it was fixed when Daniel left. However, there was another issue. We called ARS. The dispatcher connected us with Daniel. He had another job after ours but returned well after hours, on the Easter weekend, to ensure that our new fridge was repaired. We are very appreciative of Daniel's dedication and integrity to ensure that we have a working appliance. We would definitely recommend ARS and Daniel for any frustrations involving appliances!\"",

After 5 years of problems and service to this LG fridge, it was all a waste of time and large monies. The issue with the fridge could have been resolved a couple of years ago. But Northern staff obviously had a different agenda. I will request ARS in the future. But hope this is the last time an appliance in my home will have to be serviced!\"",

            "reviewBody": "\"Amazing service. This Samsung fridge has had an issue with the ice maker since I bought it. After multiple complaints to Samsung and multiple companies coming to my house wasting my time. They just thawed it out and said it's a design flaw. I almost gave up. Then I gave it one more chance. ARS was the company that came and finally solved my problem. The technician was super nice. You could tell he knew what he was doing. The ice maker has never worked better, no more freezing!!!!!! Thanks, ARS; you did an awesome job.\"",

                <p>Winter Repair</p>
<h2 id="winters-impact-on-household-appliances">Winter&rsquo;s Impact on Household Appliances</h2>
<p>Winter in Southern Ontario is a time of cozy nights and snow-covered mornings, but it&rsquo;s also the time when all our household appliances face the greatest challenges. Freezing temperatures, along with increased usage, make your appliances work harder-often to the point where they break down unexpectedly or fail to work as efficiently as one would want.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why winter-proofing your appliances is of the essence. Taking active steps towards protecting and maintaining your appliances will avoid expensive breakdowns and ensure their performance at the top, not to mention possibly extending the life of the equipment. Winter-proofing is more than repairs; it is giving life to appliances in order to make them survive through the months ahead.</p>
<p>When the chill of winter threatens your appliances, <a href="https://appliancesrepairservice.ca">ARS Appliance Repair Services</a> is the trusted name you can rely on. For years, ARS has provided seasonal appliance maintenance and repair to homeowners throughout Southern Ontario. From ensuring your washer and dryer are ready for heavy winter loads to keeping your refrigerator running efficiently, our team is dedicated to helping you stay warm, comfortable, and worry-free all season long.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for expert tips, actionable advice, and proven strategies to protect your appliances from the winter weather. Together, we&rsquo;ll keep your home running smoothly, no matter how low the temperature drops.</p>
<h3 id="how-cold-weather-affects-appliances-in-your-home">How Cold Weather Affects Appliances in Your Home</h3>
<p>The freezing temperatures that define winter can wreak havoc on the internal components of your appliances, often in ways that aren&rsquo;t immediately visible. Here&rsquo;s how:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Freezing Water Lines:</strong> Appliances like washing machines, dishwashers, and refrigerators rely on water lines to operate. In sub-zero temperatures, these lines can freeze and expand, potentially cracking or bursting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Brittle Hoses:</strong> Rubber and plastic components, such as hoses in washers and dishwashers, become less flexible in cold conditions. Over time, this brittleness can lead to leaks or complete failure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Condensation Build-Up:</strong> As warm air from your home meets cold appliance surfaces, condensation can form, leading to rust and potential electrical issues. This is especially common in refrigerators and freezers stored in unheated spaces like garages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Worn Electrical Components:</strong> Sudden temperature shifts can cause electrical wiring and connections to contract and expand, increasing the risk of short circuits or malfunctions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="increased-winter-appliance-usage">Increased Winter Appliance Usage</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the cold that stresses your appliances, winter often means heavier use, which compounds wear and tear:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Heaters:</strong> Your home&rsquo;s heating system is working overtime to keep every room warm, which can strain its efficiency. Regular use also raises the likelihood of clogged filters and reduced airflow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dryers:</strong> With heavier, bulkier winter clothes and damp outerwear in constant rotation, dryers experience increased workloads, potentially leading to overheating or lint build-up in vents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ovens and Stoves:</strong> Winter is the season for hearty meals and holiday feasts, leading to frequent use of kitchen appliances. This extra demand can accelerate wear on burners, heating elements, and electrical components.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding how winter weather affects your appliances, therefore, is the first crucial step toward protecting them. You can prevent many common issues arising with proactive care and attention. And if the cold still manages to disrupt your household&rsquo;s essential devices, ARS Appliance Repair Services is here to help. Being prepared and informed is the key, so stay ahead of challenges this season.</p>
<h2 id="essential-winter-maintenance-tips-for-major-appliances">Essential Winter Maintenance Tips for Major Appliances</h2>
<p>As the temperatures begin to cool, our appliances go into overtime, bearing the burden of keeping your house running as smoothly as usual. Winter isn&rsquo;t the only tough season for your heating system, but it presents very special challenges for the appliances one uses every day. Whether your washer does its job with bulky jackets or the refrigerator keeps the leftovers of holidays fresh, taking one&rsquo;s time to prepare their major appliances for the season is wise as far as avoiding unwanted problems and costly repairs are considered.</p>
<h3 id="preparing-major-appliances-for-cold-weather">Preparing Major Appliances for Cold Weather</h3>
<h4 id="keep-your-washer-and-dryer-running-smoothly">Keep Your Washer and Dryer Running Smoothly</h4>
<p>The winter months can leave one with a mounting stockpile of dirty laundry. From heavy bedding to damp winter coats and gloves, your washer and dryer are indispensable to your personal warmth and comfort. Unfortunately, cold weather is tough on them.</p>
<p>Begin with the washing machine hoses. These are usually made of rubber or plastic-a material that becomes brittle under freezing conditions. Cracks or small leaks in the hoses may not seem like a big deal initially, but given time, they can escalate into water damage. Replace those worn-out hoses now to save yourself from headaches later.</p>
<p>Not to be left out is your dryer. Winter clothes are usually more prone to lint production, especially when drying thicker fabrics. Clean the lint trap after each use and take a minute to look over the dryer vent. A clogged vent will dramatically cut down on drying efficiency and could become a fire hazard. If the dryer vent is vented outside, make sure the opening is clear of snow and ice since blockages can impede airflow and force your dryer to work harder than necessary.</p>
<h4 id="safeguard-your-refrigerator-and-freezer">Safeguard Your Refrigerator and Freezer</h4>
<p>When winter comes, your refrigerator and freezer take a not-so-eminent but equally important role in making your kitchen operate smoothly. Both are engineered to maintain constant inner temperatures but can be stressed if placed in unheated areas or subjected to changing room temperatures.</p>
<p>The temperature settings are well worth checking to help your refrigerator and freezer function efficiently. In colder months, your refrigerator doesn&rsquo;t have to work as hard to stay cold. Adjusting the settings just a little can save energy while keeping your food fresh. Meanwhile, make sure those condenser coils-on the back or bottom of your fridge-are clean. The dust and debris on these coils force the compressor to work harder, which, besides increasing energy costs, wears out the appliance faster.</p>
<p>Freezers, too, benefit from a little extra care. Overloading the freezer can restrict airflow, making it harder to maintain consistent temperatures. If you&rsquo;re stocking up for the holidays, leave some space between items to ensure even cooling. Properly sealing your food containers can also reduce frost build-up, keeping food fresher and your freezer running efficiently.</p>

<p>While dishwashers don&rsquo;t typically be the first thing that come to mind when thinking about cold-weather appliances, they most definitely see a lot of work during winter months with family and holiday meals. Dishwashers depend on water supply lines, which are susceptible to freezing in the colder areas of the home-such as basements or un-insulated kitchens.</p>
<p>Take a moment to inspect the water lines connected to your dishwasher. Look for any wear, leaks, or places where pipes may be subjected to freezing temperatures. Insulating these pipes can help avoid major problems, such as frozen or burst lines, which may affect your dishwasher&rsquo;s operation.</p>
<p>Another simple tip is running hot water through your kitchen faucet for a few seconds before starting a wash cycle. This allows the dishwasher to begin with warm water, reducing the strain on its internal heating system. Little adjustments like these can make a big difference in how well your dishwasher performs during the coldest months.</p>
<p>Taking the time to maintain your appliances as winter sets in doesn&rsquo;t just keep your home running; it provides peace of mind. A little proactive care now can save you from those unexpected breakdowns and costly repairs when you least expect them. If winter does bring trouble your way, ARS Appliance Repair Services is just a call away, ready to ensure your appliances are back to working order in no time.</p>
<h2 id="preventative-care-for-small-appliances">Preventative Care for Small Appliances</h2>
<p>Small kitchen appliances are the rhythm to our daily routines, especially during the winter months. From morning coffee to hearty soups and stews, these appliances make life more convenient and comforting. But extreme cold can affect performance and longevity if they&rsquo;re not properly cared for. Take a few preventative measures now to ensure your coffee maker, toaster, blender, and other small appliances function perfectly throughout the season.</p>
<h3 id="small-kitchen-appliance-tips-for-winter-care">Small Kitchen Appliance Tips for Winter Care</h3>
<p>Proper storage of small appliances is one of the major steps in their protection during winter. These devices usually have components that are highly sensitive to temperature changes, such as electrical wiring, plastic casings, and small motors. Always store them indoors, away from areas prone to extreme cold, like garages or unheated basements. Keeping small appliances in a stable, climate-controlled environment helps prevent the risk of brittleness or condensation forming on internal parts, which could lead to malfunctions.</p>
<p>Whenever small appliances have been stored for a period and are taken out for use, allow them to come up to room temperature before plugging in. Changes in temperature bring about rapid expansions or contractions in the components internally that could lead to damages. Plugging in a cold blender or toaster, for example, can also put a heavy strain on its electrical system, leading to improper heating or eventual breakdowns. Patience saves much in their functionality.</p>
<p>The other important key to winter care is regular maintenance. For appliances like coffee makers, follow the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions on cleaning. During winter, descaling will be particularly important in your coffee maker, as mineral deposits caused by hard water can build up and reduce efficiency. Similarly, check toasters for crumb accumulation; a buildup can pose a fire hazard. Keeping these devices clean means they work safely and efficiently when you need them most.</p>
<p>Small appliances are also best protected if they are not subjected to prolonged humidity. Winter air is dry inside the house, but those appliances used in areas where moisture can prevail, like kettles or steamers near sinks, should be well-dried after every use to prevent rust or corrosion.</p>
<p>These simple but effective precautions will keep your small appliances in good shape and make sure you can count on them throughout winter without surprises. In case any of your small appliances develop issues, ARS Appliance Repair Services is here to help with expert advice and repair solutions.</p>
<h2 id="home-energy-efficiency-and-appliance-longevity">Home Energy Efficiency and Appliance Longevity</h2>
<p>When winter&rsquo;s chill sets in, the efficiency of your home&rsquo;s insulation doesn&rsquo;t just impact your energy bills; it also plays a significant role in both the performance and life of your appliances. Proper insulation creates a stable indoor environment that reduces strain on your heating system and ensures your appliances operate under optimal conditions.</p>
<h3 id="how-home-insulation-helps-appliances-work-better">How Home Insulation Helps Appliances Work Better</h3>
<p>Sealing drafts and leaks around windows and doors is one of the easiest and most effective ways to improve your home&rsquo;s insulation. Gaps in these areas allow cold air to seep in and warm air to escape, forcing appliances like your heater or refrigerator to work harder to maintain consistent temperatures. Caulking and weatherstripping are affordable fixes that can significantly reduce these energy losses.</p>
<p>Beyond sealing leaks, consider the insulation in the attic and walls. Poor or underinsulated walls or an inadequately insulated attic can develop hot spots or cold zones that are overtaxing some appliances unequally. For instance, a refrigerator placed in a room with generally colder temperatures may start cycling more frequently to maintain an internal temperature. Adding or supplementing the insulation in the attic or walls will lead to more consistent environmental pressures, therefore improving the functioning and endurance of your home appliances.</p>
<p>Consistent indoor temperatures not only help bigger appliances but also protect the wiring and components of smaller ones. Many household devices have their life shortened by rapid temperature changes caused by drafts. Proper insulation is an investment in the health of your whole home, appliances included.</p>
<p>Taking steps to ensure your home is well-insulated also contributes to energy savings, which can offset the costs of maintenance or repairs. A properly sealed and insulated home allows appliances to run more smoothly, minimizing wear and tear and extending their usefulness over time.</p>
<p>A well-insulated home and the right appliance preventative care will help your appliances function at peak performance, even in the harshest winter conditions. And when you do need professional help, ARS Appliance Repair Services will be ready to provide expert maintenance and repair to keep your home running smoothly, no matter the weather.</p>
