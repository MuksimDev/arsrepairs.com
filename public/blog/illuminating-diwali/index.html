So I called LG warranty on Tuesday. They said someone would come on Friday. They could not tell me the name of the company, though. LG warranty also did not supply the repair company with my cell or proof of age of the fridge. So the ticket was cancelled. Spoke with Gila first thing Friday morning. Dealt with LG service again. Gila made magic happen. She got a technician to come out on a Friday afternoon between other calls to fix my fridge. A mental lifesaver for me, especially having had to listen to the incessant beep every 30 seconds, 24 hours a day. Thank you to the techs. But big thanks to Gila for fitting me in and understanding the necessity. This is the service that AI can never provide; the personal touch makes the difference.\"",

An ARS technician (Daniel) attended. We THOUGHT that it was fixed when Daniel left. However, there was another issue. We called ARS. The dispatcher connected us with Daniel. He had another job after ours but returned well after hours, on the Easter weekend, to ensure that our new fridge was repaired. We are very appreciative of Daniel's dedication and integrity to ensure that we have a working appliance. We would definitely recommend ARS and Daniel for any frustrations involving appliances!\"",

After 5 years of problems and service to this LG fridge, it was all a waste of time and large monies. The issue with the fridge could have been resolved a couple of years ago. But Northern staff obviously had a different agenda. I will request ARS in the future. But hope this is the last time an appliance in my home will have to be serviced!\"",

After multiple complaints to Samsung and multiple companies coming to my house wasting my time. They just thawed it out and said it's a design flaw. I almost gave up. Then I gave it one more chance. ARS was the company that came and finally solved my problem. The technician was super nice. You could tell he knew what he was doing. The ice maker has never worked better, no more freezing!!!!!! Thanks, ARS; you did an awesome job.\"",

<h2 id="the-significance-of-diwali--appliance-repair">The Significance of Diwali &amp; Appliance Repair</h2>
<p>Diwali, often referred to as Deepavali in Hindi, is more than just a festival; it&rsquo;s a tapestry of traditions, beliefs, and community. Deepavali signifies the triumph of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance. Families across India and around the world come together to celebrate this beautiful festival, creating an atmosphere of joy and unity.</p>
<p>One of the most cherished customs during Diwali is cleaning and decorating homes. People meticulously prepare their living spaces to welcome the divine light of Lord Rama, who, according to Hindu mythology, returned home after defeating the demon king Ravana. This act of cleaning symbolizes the removal of negativity and impurities, paving the way for positivity and prosperity.</p>
<p>Amidst the thorough cleaning and decoration, your appliances play a crucial role. Whether it&rsquo;s the refrigerator storing sweets, the <a href="/our-services/washer-repair/">washing machine</a> ensuring clean clothes, or the microwave oven heating up delicious treats, these appliances are the unsung heroes that contribute to the ambiance of the festival.</p>
<p>Diwali celebrates the heart of the home, where families come together to share their love and gratitude. So, maintaining these appliances in peak condition is essential for a smooth and enjoyable Diwali. After all, a well-functioning refrigerator keeps those delectable sweets fresh, a washing machine ensures your festive attire is spotless, and a microwave helps you reheat your favorite snacks effortlessly.</p>
<p>As you prepare to celebrate Diwali, remember that maintaining your appliances is not just about convenience but also about preserving the sanctity of this beautiful festival. Our next sections will explore how electrical safety, kitchen appliances, and even gifting choices during Diwali are interwoven with the world of appliance repair, helping you embrace the spirit of this festival more fully.</p>
<h2 id="appliance-repair-diwali-lighting-and-electrical-safety">Appliance Repair: Diwali Lighting and Electrical Safety</h2>
<p>As Diwali approaches, homes are adorned with a mesmerizing display of lights and electronic decorations. From the radiant glow of traditional diyas to the elaborate designs of LED lights, the festival envelops every corner of your living space in a warm, inviting luminance. However, this spectacle of light also brings forth an essential consideration – electrical safety.</p>
<p>Diwali is a time when many people use extension cords, power strips, and a multitude of electrical devices to create breathtaking displays. With the increased electrical load, it&rsquo;s crucial to ensure that your home&rsquo;s electrical systems and appliances are in pristine condition.</p>
<p>The age-old wisdom of Diwali encourages us to not only illuminate our surroundings but also to illuminate our awareness of safety. Before you plug in those decorative lights, take a moment to inspect your electrical outlets, sockets, and wiring. Look for signs of wear and tear that could pose a safety hazard.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it&rsquo;s a perfect time to check on appliances like your microwave, oven, and stovetop. Ensure they are functioning correctly to avoid unexpected electrical issues. Overheating or short circuits can be problematic, especially during a festival where lights are a dominant feature of the celebration.</p>
<p>At “Appliances Repair Service,” we understand the importance of electrical safety, especially during festive seasons. Our expert technicians are well-equipped to assess and repair any electrical issues with your appliances, ensuring that you can enjoy a bright, safe, and hassle-free Diwali.</p>
<p>In this section, we&rsquo;ve learned that while Diwali is a festival of illumination and joy, it&rsquo;s also a time to illuminate the importance of electrical safety. In the next sections, we will explore the role of kitchen appliances and gift-giving during Diwali, and how these aspects are closely related to appliance maintenance. Stay tuned to make your Diwali celebrations truly exceptional.</p>
<h3 id="diwali-feast-and-kitchen-appliance-repair">Diwali Feast and Kitchen Appliance Repair</h3>
<p>Diwali, often heralded as a festival of flavors, is a time when homes are filled with the aroma of delectable dishes and sweet treats. Preparations for the grand Diwali feast are a significant part of the celebrations, and your kitchen appliances are the unsung heroes of this culinary extravaganza.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re cooking traditional dishes like samosas, puris, or scrumptious biryani, your kitchen appliances play a pivotal role in ensuring that the festive feast is a culinary success. Consider the trusty stove or oven that helps you cook multiple dishes simultaneously, or the microwave that reheats your festive sweets to perfection. These appliances make the cooking process more efficient and enjoyable.</p>
<p>However, the effectiveness of these appliances depends on their maintenance. It&rsquo;s crucial to check and ensure that they are in prime working condition, so your Diwali culinary delights can be served effortlessly. An oven that evenly bakes your sweet treats or a stove with perfectly functioning burners can be the key to making your festive meal a memorable one.</p>

<h4 id="gifting-and-home-appliances">Gifting and Home Appliances</h4>
<p>Diwali is not only a festival of self-reflection and homecoming but also a time to express love, gratitude, and appreciation for the people in our lives. One of the most heartwarming traditions of Diwali is the exchange of gifts, a gesture that strengthens bonds and spreads happiness.</p>
<p>This Diwali, when you select gifts for your loved ones, consider the practicality and usefulness of home appliances. Gifting appliances like blenders, mixers, coffee makers, or even vacuum cleaners can be a thoughtful and pragmatic choice. These gifts enhance daily life, making routine tasks more efficient and enjoyable.</p>
<p>When choosing appliances as gifts, it&rsquo;s important to select reliable, quality products that will stand the test of time. Well-maintained appliances offer not only convenience but also longevity. Your gift can serve as a constant reminder of your love and thoughtfulness, adding to the recipient&rsquo;s joy long after the festival.</p>
<p>However, the story doesn&rsquo;t end with the gift-giving. The maintenance of these appliances also plays a significant role. Encourage the recipients of your thoughtful gifts to keep them in prime working condition by following the manufacturer&rsquo;s maintenance guidelines.</p>
<p>A well-maintained appliance not only ensures its functionality but also its safety. This is a message worth sharing, especially during Diwali, a time when we emphasize the importance of safety and well-being.</p>
<p>At “Appliances Repair Service,” we understand the value of quality appliances and the significance of gifting them during Diwali. If you or your loved ones ever face any issues with these appliances, our team is ready to assist with any necessary repairs.</p>
<h5 id="cleaning-and-diwali-appliance-maintenance">Cleaning and Diwali Appliance Maintenance</h5>
<p>Diwali is a time of purification, where families engage in an age-old tradition of deep cleaning, known as “Diwali Safai.” The practice symbolizes not only the physical cleansing of our homes but also the removal of negativity and impurities from our lives. As we illuminate our surroundings, it&rsquo;s equally important to shine a light on the significance of appliance maintenance during this ritual.</p>
<p>A thorough cleaning includes every nook and cranny of your home, including your appliances. Appliances like refrigerators, washing machines, and ovens, which you rely on for a seamless Diwali celebration, should be part of this cleansing process.</p>
<p>Cleaning your appliances involves more than just wiping away dust and grime. It also includes regular checks for signs of wear and tear. Loose wires, worn-out seals, or damaged components can lead to inefficient performance or even safety hazards.</p>
<p>Diwali is a season of joy, and your appliances can add to that joy by functioning flawlessly. A well-maintained refrigerator keeps your festive sweets fresh, while a clean washing machine ensures your Diwali attire sparkles. By incorporating appliance maintenance into your Diwali cleaning routine, you ensure that your appliances not only look their best but also perform optimally.</p>
<p>At “Appliances Repair Service,” we understand the importance of appliance maintenance during Diwali. Our team of experts can assist with servicing and maintaining your appliances to guarantee a smooth and hassle-free festival season.</p>
