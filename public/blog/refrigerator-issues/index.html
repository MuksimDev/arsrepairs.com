LG warranty also did not supply the repair company with my cell or proof of age of the fridge. So the ticket was cancelled. Spoke with Gila first thing Friday morning. Dealt with LG service again. Gila made magic happen. She got a technician to come out on a Friday afternoon between other calls to fix my fridge. A mental lifesaver for me, especially having had to listen to the incessant beep every 30 seconds, 24 hours a day. Thank you to the techs. But big thanks to Gila for fitting me in and understanding the necessity. This is the service that AI can never provide; the personal touch makes the difference.\"",

The technician Taranveer, who was on site for the 2 visits, was over and above great. The repair was completed. We now can live a normal life again. I must say this was a great experience. I truly recommend these people. Again, I thank Taranveer for his great personality and high-quality work. Please share this with him as he deserves it. Thank you.\"",

An ARS technician (Daniel) attended. We THOUGHT that it was fixed when Daniel left. However, there was another issue. We called ARS. The dispatcher connected us with Daniel. He had another job after ours but returned well after hours, on the Easter weekend, to ensure that our new fridge was repaired. We are very appreciative of Daniel's dedication and integrity to ensure that we have a working appliance. We would definitely recommend ARS and Daniel for any frustrations involving appliances!\"",

He was very knowledgeable. In the past, the unit was serviced by Northern Appliances (not at my request). After 5 years of problems and service to this LG fridge, it was all a waste of time and large monies. The issue with the fridge could have been resolved a couple of years ago. But Northern staff obviously had a different agenda. I will request ARS in the future. But hope this is the last time an appliance in my home will have to be serviced!\"",

            "reviewBody": "\"Amazing service. This Samsung fridge has had an issue with the ice maker since I bought it. After multiple complaints to Samsung and multiple companies coming to my house wasting my time. They just thawed it out and said it's a design flaw. I almost gave up. Then I gave it one more chance. ARS was the company that came and finally solved my problem. The technician was super nice. You could tell he knew what he was doing. The ice maker has never worked better, no more freezing!!!!!! Thanks, ARS; you did an awesome job.\"",

<h2 id="common-refrigerator-issues-we-fix">Common Refrigerator Issues We Fix</h2>
<p>Refrigerators are complex appliances that require regular maintenance and sometimes repairs. Some common refrigerator issues we handle include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fixing temperature problems</strong> : If your refrigerator isn&rsquo;t cooling or is too cold, it could indicate issues with the thermostat, compressor, or evaporator fan. We can quickly diagnose and resolve these issues.</li>
<li><strong>Ice maker problems</strong> : If your ice maker isn&rsquo;t working or isn&rsquo;t dispensing ice, we can fix it by checking for blockages, water line problems, or electrical faults.</li>
<li><strong>Water dispenser malfunctions</strong> : A common issue in refrigerators is when the water dispenser stops working. This could be due to a frozen line, faulty valve, or electrical issue.</li>
<li><strong>Condensation or leaks</strong> : Leaks or excess condensation inside or around the refrigerator often indicate problems with the door seals, the defrost system, or the drain system. We fix these problems by inspecting the fridge&rsquo;s internal components and seals to ensure they are functioning properly.</li>
</ul>
<p>When your <strong>broken refrigerator</strong> is causing trouble, don&rsquo;t wait for the situation to worsen. Call ARS Appliance Repair Service, and we&rsquo;ll get it working again in no time. We&rsquo;ll ensure that your refrigerator is cooling, dispensing ice and water, and functioning efficiently.</p>

<p>We purchased this microwave on Boxing Day of 2024, and unfortunately, the door detached unexpectedly. We contacted customer service on June 26th, and they informed us that a technician would be dispatched on June 30th between 9:00 AM and 12:00 PM. The technician arrived promptly at 9:15 AM and presented himself professionally. KAIES inquired about the issue and examined the microwave. In a matter of fifteen minutes, KAIES successfully installed a new door. He was exceptionally courteous and professional, completing the repair with remarkable efficiency and skill.
I would wholeheartedly recommend KAIES as an outstanding repair technician.</p>
