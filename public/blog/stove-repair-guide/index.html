LG warranty also did not supply the repair company with my cell or proof of age of the fridge. So the ticket was cancelled. Spoke with Gila first thing Friday morning. Dealt with LG service again. Gila made magic happen. She got a technician to come out on a Friday afternoon between other calls to fix my fridge. A mental lifesaver for me, especially having had to listen to the incessant beep every 30 seconds, 24 hours a day. Thank you to the techs. But big thanks to Gila for fitting me in and understanding the necessity. This is the service that AI can never provide; the personal touch makes the difference.\"",

I truly recommend these people. Again, I thank Taranveer for his great personality and high-quality work. Please share this with him as he deserves it. Thank you.\"",

An ARS technician (Daniel) attended. We THOUGHT that it was fixed when Daniel left. However, there was another issue. We called ARS. The dispatcher connected us with Daniel. He had another job after ours but returned well after hours, on the Easter weekend, to ensure that our new fridge was repaired. We are very appreciative of Daniel's dedication and integrity to ensure that we have a working appliance. We would definitely recommend ARS and Daniel for any frustrations involving appliances!\"",

After 5 years of problems and service to this LG fridge, it was all a waste of time and large monies. The issue with the fridge could have been resolved a couple of years ago. But Northern staff obviously had a different agenda. I will request ARS in the future. But hope this is the last time an appliance in my home will have to be serviced!\"",

After multiple complaints to Samsung and multiple companies coming to my house wasting my time. They just thawed it out and said it's a design flaw. I almost gave up. Then I gave it one more chance. ARS was the company that came and finally solved my problem. The technician was super nice. You could tell he knew what he was doing. The ice maker has never worked better, no more freezing!!!!!! Thanks, ARS; you did an awesome job.\"",

                <p>Stove Repair</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another rainy day in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Toronto_Area">GTA</a>, and spring showers are in full effect. As we transition through the seasons, keeping your home appliances in top shape becomes increasingly important. When it comes to stove repair, ensuring your appliance is functioning properly is not just about convenience; it&rsquo;s a matter of safety and energy efficiency. In this comprehensive guide, we&rsquo;ll delve into the common issues that can affect your stove&rsquo;s performance, from heating elements and burners to gas leaks and strange noises.</p>
<p>Our focus is to provide you with a thorough understanding of the potential problems you may encounter with your stove, as well as practical DIY troubleshooting tips to address them. Whether you&rsquo;re dealing with a stove that won&rsquo;t heat up, a burner that stops working, or a gas stove that smells like gas, we&rsquo;ll cover it all. Additionally, we&rsquo;ll discuss when it&rsquo;s crucial to seek professional repair services for more complex or hazardous issues.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get started by exploring the most common faults and malfunctions that can occur with stoves and how to address them effectively. This guide aims to equip you with the knowledge you need to keep your stove running smoothly and safely throughout the year.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-my-stove-not-heating-up">Why Is My Stove Not Heating Up?</h2>
<p>A stove that doesn&rsquo;t heat up can be frustrating and disrupt your daily routine. Let&rsquo;s examine some common causes and troubleshooting tips to address this issue:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Faulty Burners or Heating Elements</strong> : One of the most common reasons for a stove not heating up is a faulty burner or heating element. Over time, these components may wear out or malfunction, resulting in inefficient or no heating.</li>
<li><strong>Electrical Issues</strong> : Electric stoves rely on a consistent power supply to function properly. Issues such as a tripped circuit breaker, loose wiring, or a blown fuse can prevent your stove from receiving the power it needs to heat up.</li>
<li><strong>Control Knob Problems</strong> : Sometimes, the control knobs that regulate heat levels can become loose or damaged, leading to inconsistent or no heat from your stove.</li>
<li><strong>Thermostat Malfunction</strong> : If your stove uses a thermostat to regulate temperature, a malfunctioning thermostat can prevent the stove from reaching the desired heat levels.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="troubleshooting-tips">Troubleshooting Tips:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check the Burners or Heating Elements</strong> : Inspect the burners or heating elements for visible signs of damage, such as cracks or corrosion. If you find any, consider replacing the damaged parts.</li>
<li><strong>Test the Electrical Connection</strong> : Make sure your stove is properly plugged in and that the circuit breaker is in the “on” position. If the breaker keeps tripping, it may indicate a more serious electrical issue.</li>
<li><strong>Inspect the Control Knobs</strong> : Verify that the control knobs are securely attached and functioning as expected. Replace any damaged or faulty knobs.</li>
<li><strong>Test the Thermostat</strong> : If your stove uses a thermostat, you may need to test it using a multimeter to ensure it&rsquo;s working properly. A faulty thermostat may require replacement.</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases, these troubleshooting steps may resolve the issue, but if the stove still doesn&rsquo;t heat up, it may be time to seek professional repair services. Identifying and addressing the underlying problem promptly can prevent further damage and ensure the safety and efficiency of your stove.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-fix-a-stove-that-wont-turn-on">How to Fix a Stove That Won&rsquo;t Turn On</h2>
<p>When your stove refuses to turn on, it can be a sign of a more serious issue. Here are some common causes and troubleshooting steps to help you diagnose and fix the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Electrical Supply Issues</strong> : A stove that won&rsquo;t turn on might be due to problems with the electrical supply, such as a tripped circuit breaker, blown fuse, or loose wiring.</li>
<li><strong>Control Panel Malfunctions</strong> : Electronic stoves may have control panels that can malfunction due to a software error, damaged buttons, or defective components.</li>
<li><strong>Power Cord Problems</strong> : The power cord can become damaged over time or during installation, leading to a lack of power supply to the stove.</li>
<li><strong>Defective Switches or Relays</strong> : Stoves have switches and relays that control the power flow to the heating elements. Defective switches or relays can prevent the stove from turning on.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="troubleshooting-tips-1">Troubleshooting Tips:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inspect the Electrical Supply</strong> : Check your home&rsquo;s electrical panel for tripped breakers or blown fuses. Reset any tripped breakers and replace blown fuses.</li>
<li><strong>Examine the Power Cord</strong> : Inspect the power cord for visible signs of damage such as fraying, cuts, or burn marks. Replace the cord if necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Check the Control Panel</strong> : For electronic stoves, ensure that the control panel is functioning correctly. Test the buttons and dials for responsiveness.</li>
<li><strong>Test the Switches and Relays</strong> : If you suspect faulty switches or relays, you may need to use a multimeter to test their continuity. Replace any defective components.</li>
</ul>
<p>If these troubleshooting steps don&rsquo;t resolve the issue, you may be dealing with a more complex electrical problem that requires professional repair. Addressing the underlying cause promptly is crucial for maintaining your stove&rsquo;s safety and performance.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-do-when-a-stove-element-stops-working">What to Do When a Stove Element Stops Working</h2>
<p>A stove element that stops working can significantly impact your cooking experience. To resolve this issue, you need to identify the underlying cause and take appropriate action. Here are some possible causes and steps to fix the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Burnt Out Element</strong> : The most common reason for a stove element to stop working is that it has burned out. This can happen over time due to regular use.</li>
<li><strong>Loose Connections</strong> : Loose wiring connections between the element and the stove can interrupt power flow, preventing the element from heating up.</li>
<li><strong>Control Switch Issues</strong> : The control switch that regulates the element&rsquo;s power may be faulty or damaged, causing the element not to work.</li>
<li><strong>Element Socket Malfunction</strong> : The element socket may be damaged or worn out, leading to poor contact with the element and causing it to stop working.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="troubleshooting-tips-2">Troubleshooting Tips:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check the Element</strong> : Inspect the element for visible signs of damage, such as cracks or burn marks. If the element looks damaged, it may need to be replaced.</li>
<li><strong>Inspect Connections</strong> : Check the wiring connections to ensure they are secure and free from corrosion. Tighten any loose connections you find.</li>
